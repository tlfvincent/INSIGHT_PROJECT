<strong>Is it possible to leverage screenplay information to predict movie profitability and assist the descision-making process for screenplay selection?</strong>

- A. There is a high linear relationship between movie budget and box office revenue.

## Predicting the profitability of a movie
- Some features that were tried but failed to produce convincing results: readability index, sentiment analysis, tf-idf, tf-idf with POS tagging.

- word2vec - Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space (published by Google).

- Allows to cluster words with similar meaning. These clusters can be used as features in a predictive model.

$$
\hat{y} = x_{budget} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i, word2vec}
$$

## Predicting the profitability of a movie
- Used 10-fold cross-validation to benchmark a variety of regression models for profitability prediction: linear regression (LR), MARS, SVM, Random Forest (RF), Generalized boosting (GBM) and CART.

## Predicting the profitability of a movie
- Because we only use screenplay information, the main challenge is the identification, extraction and selection of features that may be available in movie scripts.

- Some features that were tried but failed to produce convincing results: readability index, sentiment analysis, tf-idf, tf-idf with POS tagging.

- word2vec - Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space (published by Google).

- Allows to cluster words with similar meaning. These clusters can be used as features in a predictive model.

## Movie analytics
- The data also offers the opportunity for some sentiment analysis of movie scripts.
