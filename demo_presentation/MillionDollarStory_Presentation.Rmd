- Currently a postdoctoral associate at Weill Cornell Medical College (New York), where I try and detect genetic mutations that can explain why some smokers suffer from lung disease while others don't.

- Although the movie industry is a growing multi-billion dollar endeavor, there are no hardset guidelines to predict box office income.
- <strong>Is it possible to leverage screenplay information to predict box office revenue and flop probability?</strong>

## Data Collection
* Collect movie metadata from:
    + IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes API
* Scrape movie screenplay data from:
    + springfieldspringfield.co.uk
 * In total, we have 2428 movies with data available for:
    + revenue
    + budget
    + movie screenplay

## Movie analytics
- This is a data-rich problem.
- Can look at a variety of effects such as the role of movie genre, the value of actors, historical trends in movie runtime etc...

## Movie analytics
- The data also offers the opportunity for some sentiment analysis of movie scripts.

## Predicting Flops

- There a high linear relationship between movie budget and box office revenue.
- Instead, it is more interesting to predict the flop probability of a movie.
- Because we ignore all metadata information, the largest challenge is the identification, extraction and selection of features that may be available in movie scripts.

## Predicting Flops
- word2vec - Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space (published by Google)
- Allows to cluster words with similar meaning. These clusters can be used as features in a predictive model.
- Benchmarked a variety of models for flop classification, logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), SVM, Gradient boosting (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NN) etc...
