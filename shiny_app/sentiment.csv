"2","Knowing Djangos a slaver and for his dinner table privileges the Domestic Slaves despise Django."
"2","Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade."
"2","We pick up the conversation in midnegotiation."
"2","Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ Look Monsieur Candle they were all fine specimens no doubt about it."
"2","But the best three by far were Sampson Goldie and Eskimo Joe."
"2","By the way whys he called Eskimo Joe CALVIN CANDIE Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started."
"2","His name was Joe."
"2","maybe one day he said he was cold."
"2","who knows Dr."

"2","Can he take Goldie probably not Goldies the best dirty fightin nigger I ever saw."
"2","But as long as you dont put em up against those two."

"2","// F Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ You must understand Monsieur Candie while admittedly a."
"2","neophyte in the nigger fight game I do have a bit of a background in the European traveling circus."

"2","but is he right as rain."
"2","Everyone waits for Calvins response."
"2","He milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep then says; CALVIN CANDIE Dr."
"2","Schultz i will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then Monsieur Calvin J."
"2","Candie."
"2","But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game."
"2","(BEAT) A nigger that can win fights."
"2","That should be your first second third four and fifth concern."
"4","After you have that and you know you have that then you can start to implement a grande design."
"4","But since I enjoy oldest man at the table status beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise first things first."
"2","Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans."
"2","Dr."
"2","Schultz says something pleasant to her in German."
"2","She smiles and says something pleasant back."
"2","CALVIN CANDIE I see you two gettin on Dr."
"2","Schultz breaks into a wide grin; Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ."

"2","Â»5 Everybody at the table chuckles."
"2","Dr."
"0","SCHULTZ I cant express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue."
"2","And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion."
"2","As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy Lara Lee notices how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other."
"2","Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie."
"2","LARA LEE I dont know doctor you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for Django."
"0","Lara Lee has no idea how right she is but when she said it all three Django Broomhilda and Schultz involuntarily jerk."
"2","AND."
"2","STEPHEN sees it."
"2","Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook."
"0","Except for Stephen no one else was the wiser."
"2","Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen."
"2","Stephen watches her go then looks at Django then hands Candie his mint julep and goes into a broad routine for the tables benefit."
"2","CALVIN CANDIE Stephen youre amazing."
"2","I havent finished a drink in this house in twenty years."
"2","STEPHEN When a man likes a cold drink a man likes a COLD drink."

"4","When theyre a guest in somebodys house and the master of of the house thinks hes funny you suppose to laugh."
"2","Theyd be rude not to."
"2","Chuckle."
"2","chuckle."
"2","They play their little comedy routine for all its worth."
"2","CALVIN CANDIE No it was really funny (TO TABLE) wasnt it STEPHEN Now what do you expect these people to say What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest."
"2","(TO TABLE) Everybody dont laugh at him youre being polite I understand you mean well but it just encourages him."
"2","Chucklechuckle."
"2","As the white folks chuckle Stephen moves back into the kitchen."
"4","TNT KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT Once Stephen enters the kitchen his smile melts away and he locks eyes on Broomhilda."
"2","He moves over to her."
"2","STEPHEN You know that nigger /ï¿½ She spins around."
"2","11 7 BROOMHILDAÂ¢ Who STEPHEN Dont stall me bitch you know who BROOMHILDA At the table I dont know him."

"2","But if it was my money I wouldnt pay twelve thousand dollars for him."
"2","Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ What would your price be DJANGO Well if I was inclined to be generous."
"2","and I dont know why I would be inclined to be generous."
"2","nine thousand."
"2","maybe."
"2","Candies lawyer chimes in."
"2","MOGUY But the real question is not how much he cost but how much he can earn Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ Django DJANGO In a years time seven or eight fights outside of Mississippi where his Candyland pedigree werent well known Virginia."
"2","(CONT) 11Y DJANGO (CONT) Georgia all goes well."
"2","twenty to twenty one thousand dollars."
"2","CALVIN CANDIE Precisely Bright Boy good on ya."
"2","Any way you cut that cake that spells profit."
"2","Not to mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger."
"2","However let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about."
"2","It wasnt me who came to you to sell a nigger it was you who approached me to buy one."
"2","Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about aint too far off from right."
"2","And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that I could sell em any day of the week."
"2","But like you said in Greenville doctor I dont wanna sell em."
"2","It was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it."
"2","Dr."
"2","Schultz considersCalvin Candies words then suddenly says; Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ You know Monsieur Candie."
"2","you do possess the power of persuasion."
"2","Candie smiles at that remark."

"4","SCHULTZ Why not Monsieur Candie you have a deal Eskimo Joe twelve thousand dollars The White people at the table get very happy."
"2","Dr."
"2","Schultz continues; Dr."
"2","SCHULTZ However that is a tremendous amount of money."
"2","And the way you have your Mr."
"2","Moguy I have a lawyer a persnickety man named Tuttle."
"0","And I would need my man to draw up a legal contract before I would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh."
"2","Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing."
"4","So say I return in about five days time with my Mr."
"2","Tuttle."
"2","And then my Mr."
"2","Tuttle and your Mr."
"2","Moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves."
"2","117 CALVIN CANDIE Splendid."

"2","CALVIN CANDIE Its a lot better then sizzling in that hot box or draggin your ass through a bramble bush aint it BROOMHILDA Yes em."
"2","With Candie interrogating Broomhilda Django tenses up."

"2","STEPHEN You know Monsieur Candle the doctor might be interested in seein Hildis peeled back."
