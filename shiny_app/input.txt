DJANGO UNCHAINED Written by Quentin Tarantino I EXT COUNTRYSIDE BROILING HOT DAY As the films OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays complete with its own SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS being run by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.
The location is somewhere in Texas.
The Black Men (ROY BIG SID BENJAMIN DJANGO PUDGY RALPH FRANKLYN and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville Mississippi.
The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).
One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO.
hes fourth in the leg iron line.
We may or may not notice a tiny small r burned into his cheek (r for runaway) but we cant help but notice his back which has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.
As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays we see a MONTAGE of misery and pain as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering sun pounding rain and moved along by the end of a whip.
Bare feet step on hard rock and slosh through mud puddles.
Leg Irons take the skin off ankles.
AS The CREDITS play DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty its usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters from his past.
In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the Greenville Auction.
DJANGO Amongst many other shoulders and heads sees through the bars of the cell door his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.
He fights his way to the door and far off and obscure in the distance he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block and in the distance he hears the Auctioneer yell; Sold.
Then shes taken away to whereabouts unknown never to be seen again.
As the sun continues to beat down on Djangos head he remembers; DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed for forty.
WHITE MEN yank him out.
of the cell shirtless shoeless and lead him down a hallway into a giant round pen an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the structure.
The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front of the auction block.
2 DJANGO is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men) and their MASTERS (their White Owners) and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing the sales pitch on the auction block) as they wait for their turn on the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE) stand on the auction block in view of the room full of Buyers The SELLER sells and the OWNERS stand off to the side.
DJANGO takes in the environment around him.
Django has never cared for white folks but these white folks are in particularly ugly.
Its DJANGOs turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo Django is brought up on the auction block.
He.
looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to buy Niggers who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.
BACK TO DJANGO walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions walking across the blistering Texas panhandle.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE end.
/ EXT WOODS NIGHT Its night time and The Speck Brothers astride HORSES keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward.
Its a very pitch black night with only a few stars in the.
sky to create a little top light.
Its so dark the Slavers use the creek.
bed to keep from getting lost.
Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on their horse as.
does Roy the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
Its also a bitterly cold night with the breath of the seven slaves two slavers and two horses creating clouds in the air.
In fact the seven chained together Slaves with the lead one holding a lantern and all of them chugging out smoky breath and.
slightly moving in unison resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs both Speck Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings and white fur collars.
WHEN.
A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road.
This makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock and ready their rifles for possible trouble.
3 A BLACK HORSE carrying a dressed in grey Rider CLIPCLOPS from the background to the foreground illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.
THE RIDER appears to be a tenderfoot due to his style of dress.
A long grey wintercoat over a grey three piece business suit and a grey bowler hat on his head.
DICKY SPECK Whos that stumblin around in the dark State your business or prepare to get winged THE RIDER Calm yourselves gentlemen I mean you no harm.
Im simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two Slavers and their Slaves lifting the lantern up to his face.
He speaks with a slight German accent.
THE RIDER (to the Slavers) Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves) Good eveningIm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by thename of The Speck Brothers.
Might that be you ACE SPECK Who wants to.

King Schultz and this is my horse Fritz.
Fritz does a little bow with his head a neat trick the doctor taught him.
DICKY SPECK You a doctor Dr.
SCHULTZ Affirmative.
DICKY SPECK What kinda doctor Dr.
SCHULTZ Dentist.

SCHULTZ So I wish to parley with you.
ACE SPECK Speak English Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh Im sorry.
Please forgive me it is a second language.
Amongst your inventory Ive been led to believe is a specimen Im keen to acquire.
(to the slaves) Hello you poor devils.
Is there one among you who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness.
In the darkness a VOICE rings out; DJANGOS VOICE (OS) Im from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.
Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness raises his lantern illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Splendid And whats your name young man DJANGO Django.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Wunderbar Youre exactly the one Im looking for.
So tell me Django by the way thats a amazing name during your time at the Carrucan Plantation did you come to know three overseers by the name of The Brittle Brothers Django nods his head yes.
Dr.
Schultz is delighted.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Big John Ellis and little brother Raj DJANGO Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So Django do you think you could recognize ï¿½.
The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their Slave in polite conversation.
with a touch of disbelief.
ACE SPECK Hey stop talkin to him like that Dr.
SCHULTZ Like what ACE SPEC Like that Dr.
SCHULTZ My good man Im simply trying to ascertain ACE SPECK Speak English goddamit Dr.
SCHULTZ Everybody calm down Im simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.
ACE SPECK I dont care no sale.
Now off wit ya Dr.
SCHULTZ Dont be ridiculous of course theyre for sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.
ACE SPECK Move it Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.
SCHULTZ My good man did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention.
ACE SPECK Last chance fancy pants Dr.
SCHULTZ Very well The doctor throws his lantern to the ground enveloping him in darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his holster and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face.
BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse dead in the dirt.
Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans direction.
BAM.
Dr.
SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head.
The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him.
When the dead weight horse lands on Dickys slightly twisted leg we hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this.
Theyve never seen a white man kill another white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark the German climb down off his horse pick up Aces discarded lantern and walk over to the remaining Speck.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didnt want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.
Sch.
ultz LIGHTS the lantern illuminating himself as he stands over Dickys body.
DICKY SPECK You goddamn son of a bitch you killed Ace Dr.
SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.
And I do believe I have.
(COUNTING OUT THE SLAVES).
one two three four five six seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.
DICKY SPECK My damn legs busted Dr.
SCHULTZ No doubt.
Now if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum Id like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
(TO DJANGO) As I was saying if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again would you recognize them DJANGO Yes.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Now Im sure.
to you all unshaven white men look alike.
So Django in a crowd of unshaven white men can you honestly and positively point out The Brittle Brothers DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK Were in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation.
Its PISSING RAIN outside.
Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda when she stops letting out a shout.
The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS are outside peeking in through the window.
They BURST in through the front door.
Soaked to the bone they rodeo bull their way into the shack and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg.
they fondle his ass.
they squeeze her tit.
they bring a belt across Djangos backside to make him fuck faster.
then they yank him off as BIG JOHN climbs on top of Broomhilda.
the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts and make him sit in the corner while they finish with his wife.
BACK TO DJANGO DJANGO I can point em out.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Sold American So Mr.
Speck how much for Django DICKY SPECK Im gonna lose this leg Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes unless you find a talented physician very quickly Im afraid that will be the.
end result.
But back to business how much do you want for Django DICKY SPECK You go to hell Dr.
SCHULTZ Dont be silly.
How much for Django DICKY SPECK 800 dollars Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh come now I may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does but neither was I born yesterday.
8 The.
good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
Dr.
SCHULTZ In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked up at The Greenville Slave Auction it says that the going rate for African flesh in particularly a field nigger _is sixty to eighty dollars.
Now handsome no doubt as Django is technically he is a field.
nigger.
Which according tothis pamphlet here and why would they lie puts his price at eighty dollars.
So in light of that how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young Django here.
Dr.
Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket and takes out a one hundred dollar bill two tens and a fiver.
Dr.
SCHULTZ And since your late brother.
wont be using it anymore Id like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his.
pocket and tosses it on Dickys body.
He bends down and puts the paper money.
in the saddle bags on Dickys dead horse.
With.
his hands in there he roots around and finds the keys tothe leg irons.
He unlocks Djangos leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.
SCHULTZ There you go Django.
Give your ankles a good rubbing then get up on that horse.
Also if I was you Id take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver.
Puts on the warm jacket over his bare back and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.
Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Mr.
Speck I am afraid I will require a bill of sale.
Do you have one Dicky just curses him.
He says removing a notebook from his pocket; Dr.
SCHULTZ I thought not.
No worries I come prepared.
(as he writes) This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops then says to Django) Django is spelled with a silent D is it not 9 DJANGO Huh Dr.
SCHULTZ Why not.
He writes it in his book with a silent D then stops to admire the way it looks.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down under his horse and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.
SCHULTZ If youd be so kind Speck as to make your mark here.
The.
Hillbilly spits in the German gentlemans face.
The good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief.
Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that cant be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Mr.
Speck I would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz and looks to the six Slaves in leg irons.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So as I.
see it when it comes to the subject of what to do next you gentlemen have two choices.
One once Im gone you lift that beast off the remaining Speck then carry him to the nearest town.
Which would be at least thirtyseven miles back the way you came.
Or.
Two you unshackle yourselves take that rifle over there.
put a bullet in his head bury the two of them deep and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
Hes just about ready to ride off when the good doctor adds; 0 Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh and on the off chance that theres any astronomy aficionados amongst you the North Star is THAT ONE.
Tata.
He looks to Django who doesnt know how to start his horse.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Just give him a little kick.
Django does and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.
SCHULTZ See its not so difficult.
EXT MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE SUNRISE The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape.
The two men ride their horses silently horse hooves CLIPCLOPPING among the rocks.
Django wears Specks winter coat with one of Dr.
Schultzs white button down dress shirts underneath it.
As they ride through the picturesque scene.
Dr.
Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So Django what do you intend to name him DJANGO Who Dr.
SCHULTZ Your horse DJANGO What horse Dr.
SCHULTZ The horse youre riding.
DJANGO This aint my horse.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes it is.
DJANGO No it aint its your horse.
Im just riding it.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Well technically yes Wait a minute technically not.
If its my horse I can give it to you and as of now Im doing such.
Django youre now the proud owner of a horse congratulations.
/1 DJANGO I cant feed no horse.
I cant put no horse up in no stable.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (FRUSTRATED) Dont worry about all that They ride a bit longer in silence.
the good doctor composes himself.
then says with a smile; Dr.
SCHULTZ So.
now that thats settled.
what do you intend to name it Half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name.
For instance my steed is named Fritz.
Hes stubborn ornery and prone to a bad disposition but I couldnt do without him.
(he pats Fritzs neck) Anyway the name of ones steed isnt something one does lightly.
So once youve thought about it for awhile DJANGO Tony.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Tony what DJANGO I dunno Tony the horse.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh you mean you want to name your horse Tony DJANGO Yeah.
Thats what you jus asked me right Dr.
SCHULTZ When youre right youre right indeed I did.
Why Tony DJANGO I gotta tell ya You didnt tell me I gotta tell ya.
As they continue to converse they start heading downhill toward a western town.
They pass by a sign that says; WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY TEXAS /Z Dr.
SCHULTZ Well Im naturally curious of course but theres no reason you MUST tell me.
In fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed.
And I do believe Tony wears it well.
Good job Django well done.
EXT THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY MORNING As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up Django and Dr.
Schultz ride Fritz and Tony through the main street of town.
Daughtrey looks like a million western towns weve seen before in movies.
But to the TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey Django and the German dont look like a million other visitors.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Whats everybody staring at DJANGO They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Whats this bizarre obsession they have with.
you not riding horses DJANGO You askin me Dr.
Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon and dismounts.
Django has a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him but it gets done.
Dr.
Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in As per usual with this white man Django thinks; What Dr.
SCHULTZ Im just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do and what you cant do and if you cant do it why cant you do it Like for instance what if we were to walk in this saloon here sit down at a table order a drink and drink it Would the authorities frown on that DJANGO Hell yeah they gonna frown.
Dr.
SCHULTZ What part would they find the most offensive 13 DJANGO All of it.
I cant be walkin in no saloon.
I cant be sittin my ass on no chair at no table.
I cant be drinkin no drink.
And I definitely cant be sharin no drink with no white man in public.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So if you and I did those things that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff DJANGO You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Well in that case Django after you.
DJANGO Whoa I aint funnin I cant go in there.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Django youre going to have to learn to trust me and as the man said; Theres no time like thepresent.
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment.
INT SALOON MORNING The nervous black slave and the confident Germandentist walk into the saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a table to change a candle in the saloons chandelier.
His back is turned away from the two patrons.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Good morning inn keeper two beers for two weary travelers.
SALOON KEEPER Its still pretty early we wont be open for about a hour.
But by then well be servin breakfast He turns around and sees them.
SALOON KEEPER Whoa What the hell you think you doin boy get that nigger outta here.
IT TIME CUT EXT SALOON MORNING Its about five minutes later and the Saloon Keeper comes running out of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.
Schultz sitting at a table with the young Django calls; Dr.
SCHULTZ Inn keeper Remember get the sheriff not the marshall.
This wouldnt be the marshalls jurisdiction.
This is just a infraction on what I assume is a simple county ordinance and that would fall under the domain of the Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.
SCHULTZ It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up and walksbehind the bar and pours two beers from the tap into mugs.
Django remains seated and after a beat asks; DJANGO What kinda dentist are you This makes the doctor laugh as he pours the beers.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I havent practiced dentistry in five years Not to say once I know you better I wouldnt like to get a look at that mouth Im sure its a disaster But these days I practice a new profession.
Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is The Black Man shakes his head no.
As the good doctor walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer HE EXPLAINS; Dr.
SCHULTZ Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
15 Dr.
SCHULTZ (CONTD) The state places a bounty on a mans head.
I track that man I find that man I kill that man.
After Ive killed him I transport that mans corpse back to the authorities and sometimes thats easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities proving yes indeed I have truly killed him At which point the authorities pay me the bounty.
(lifting his beer) Cheers.
The two men touch glasses and take a drink.
DJANGO Whats a bounty Dr.
SCHULTZ Its like a reward.
DJANGO You kill people and they give you a reward Dr.
SCHULTZ Certain people yes.
DJANGO White people Dr.
SCHULTZ Mostly.
A few Mexicans.
Couple Chinamen.
DJANGO Bad people Dr.
SCHULTZ Badder they are bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you and I must admit Im at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.
On one hand I despise slavery.
On the other hand I need your help and if youre not in a position to refuse all the better.
So for the time being Im going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit.
(BEAT) Still.
having said that.
I feel guilty.
So.
Id like the two of us to enter into an agreement.
Im looking for The Brittle Brothers however in this endeavor Im at a slight disadvantage in so far as I dont know what they look like.
But you do.
dontcha 1G ï¿½.
DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK Django back at The Carrucan Plantation held down by Roger and Ellis Brittle as Big John BURNS the r into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.
BACK TO DJANGO DJANGO I know what they look like all right.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Good.
So heres my agreement.
You travel with me till we find them DJANGO Where we goin Dr.
SCHULTZ I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg but I dont know where.
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.
And when we find them you point them out and I kill them.
You do that I agree to give you your freedom.
twentyfive dollars per Brittle brother thats seventyfive dollars.
your horse Tony even though Ive already gave him to you but once the final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust Ill buy you a new saddle and a new suit of clothes handsome cowboy hat included.
Dr.
Schultzs eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.
SCHULTZ And as if on cue.
here comes the sheriff.
EXT SALOON MORNING We see the sheriff BILL SHARP walk towards the saloon cradling a Winchester.
Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to watch.
YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.
SHERIFF SHARP Okay boys funs over come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do The Sheriff says; 1 2 SHERIFF SHARP Now why yall wanna come into my town start trouble and scare all these nice people You aint got nothin better to do then to come into Bill Sharps town and show your ass From his top step on the porch Dr.
King Schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff as if to shake it.
THEN.
A SMALL DERRINGER POPS into Schultzs hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve.
Once in hand the dentist FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan and doubles over in the dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps to the fallen sheriff reloading his tiny pop shooter a PEDESTRIAN yells out; PEDESTRIAN What did you jus do to our sheriff Dr.
Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law mans skull killing him dead.
In the background ONE WOMAN faints.
The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.
Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper across the street.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Now you can go get the marshall.
TIME CUT EXT DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET DAY U.
MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.
MARSHALL TATUM Move that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon.
And I want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this roof and two men with two rifles on that roof with all barrels pointed at that front door.
And somebody git poor Bill outta the goddamn street.
LP Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.
WHEN.
COMING FROM THE SALOON.
PIANO MUSIC.
INT SALOON DAY Dr.
Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano player.
A terrified Django whos sure his new master is a lunatic whos going to get them both killed peeks out the closed curtains on the window.
Dr.
Schultzs suit coat sits draped over a chair.
All of his weapons including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.
SCHULTZ What are they doing DJANGO I think they wonderin why you playin the piana.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Good.
(PAUSE) But what are they doing DJANGO A buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front now they hidin behind it with guns.
And a buncha other white folks are up on the roof with rifles pointed down here.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Damn they got that organized fast.
Is the marshall out there DJANGO If the one I think is the.
marshall is the marshall hes out there.
)9 Dr.
SCHULTZ What makes you think hes the marshall DJANGO Cause hes the one ready to say somethin.
MARSHALLS VOICE You in the saloon Dr.
Schultz stops playing the piano.
MARSHALLS VOICE We got eleven Winchesters on every way outta that buildin You got once chance git outta this alive You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head and I mean right now Dr.
SCHULTZ First things first Is this the marshall I have the pleasure of addressing MARSHALL TATUM Yes it is this is U.
Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Wunderbar So marshall I have relieved myself of all weapons and just as you have instructed Im ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of The United States of America I shant be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies before Ive had my day in court.
MARSHALL TATUM You mean like you did our sheriff Shot em down like a dog in the street Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes thats exactly what I mean Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street MARSHALL TATUM Well as much as wed all enjoy seein somethin like that aint nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town Dr.
SCHULTZ Fair enough marshall here we.
come.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (TO DJANGO) Theyre a little tense out there.
So dont make any quick movements and let me do the talking.
Django looks at him like as if.
EXT SALOON/MAIN STREET DAY A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open and Dr.
Schultz and Django hands raised step outside.
MARSHALL TATUM You unarmed Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes indeed we are.
Marshall Tatum may I address you your deputies and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey as to the incident that just occurred MARSHALL TATUM Go on Dr.
SCHULTZ My name is Dr.
King Schultz.
And like yourself marshall I am a servant of the court.
The man lying dead in the dirt who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff who went by the name of Bill Sharp is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck with a price on his head of two hundred dollars.
Thats two hundred dollars dead or alive.
MARSHALL TATUM The hell you say Dr.
SCHULTZ I.
m aware this is probably disconcerting news.
But Im willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years.
I know this because.
three years ago he was rustling cattle from The B.
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock Texas.
Z/ Dr.
SCHULTZ (CONTD) In my possession.
is a warrant made out by circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.
You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles begin trading looks.
Then Dr.
Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.
SCHULTZ In other words marshall you owe me two hundred dollars.
CUT TO EXT TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD DAY Django and Dr.
Schultz who by now have ridden quite a few miles together ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside on the way to Gatlinburg.
Dr.
Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey business suits and Django is still dressed in his slave pants Schultzs button down dress shirt and Ace Specks winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared onhis feet.
Dr.
SCHULTZ One needs a plan son.
These are brutal times.
A man who survives is a man with a plan.
A man who thrives is a man with a good plan.
So having said that whats your plan young Django DJANGO Whatcha mean Dr.
SCHULTZ Well after this Brittle business is behind us youll be a free man with a horse and seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
Whats your plan after that DJANGO Find my wife and buy her freedom.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Django I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of matrimony seriously DJANGO Huh ZZ Dr.
SCHULTZ Do slaves believe in marriage DJANGO Me and my wife do.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Where is she now DJANGO I dunno.
They put us in different boxcars and sent U.
S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days fore me.
But I dont know who to.
Dr.
Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Care for some jerky DJANGO Sure.
Dr.
Schultz rips him off a piece.
Django chews on it.
As he chews SCHULTZ SAYS; Dr.
SCHULTZ So your plan is to trackdowri your wife and purchase her.
freedom Only you dont know where she is A chewing Django nods his head yes.
Dr.
Schultz takes a big bite of jerky chews for a moment contemplating the dilemma then pronounces; Dr.
SCHULTZ Well that shouldnt be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen DJANGO A few months ago.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Three or four DJANGO Three.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation and shewassold at The Greenville Slave Auctiontosome :unknown customer three monthsago Django nods his head yes.
Z3 Dr.
SCHULTZ The bad part about slavery being a business is its immoral.
The good part about it being a business is they keep records.
Somewhere in Greenville theres a book with your wifes name in it and the name of the customer who bought her and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Still seventyfive dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice grub steak but its not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in Mississippi isnt the safest place you could visit.
Free or not.
DJANGO Ill have my freedom papers.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes you will.
But say you show them to some rascals and they take them from you and tear them up DJANGO They could do that Dr.
SCHULTZ Im not saying they would but they could.
DJANGO They do that Ill kill em.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Great Now you get hung for killin a white man.
The point being is the placeis just too dangerous for you.
DJANGO Well I gotta go when do I go Dr.
SCHULTZ When you get more dangerous.
EXT CHATTANOOGA DAY Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga.
Were in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS.
Django comes bursting out of the stores back door.
Hes very distressed.
One glance at the outfit hes wearing explains the distress.
Z DJANGO is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit that wouldnt be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at Versailles.
Dr.
Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Django you have to its part of The Act.
Youre playing a character.
Your character is The Valet.
This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you.
During the act you can never break character.
CUT TO EXT BENNETT MANOR DAY We see Dr.
Schultz riding slightly in front of Django dressed in his blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit as they enter the property of BENNETT MANOR a plantation in Gatlinburg Tennessee.
Django leads a riderless horse behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of Bennett Manor alongside the cotton fields all the SLAVES stop picking cotton and straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor SPENCER BIG DADDY BENNETT dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day emerges from the double doors of the mansion and stands on the top steps hands on hips watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields the majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.
BLACK FEMALES fourteen to twentyfour referred to as PONYS.
The biggest money making crop of this farm after cotton.
As Dr.
Schultz and fancy pants Django bring Fritz and Tony to a stop in front of Bennett Manor theyve drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEERS).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he wont be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse.
SPENCER BENNETT Its against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.
Dr.
SCHULTZ This is my valet and my valet doesnt walk.
SPENCER BENNETT I said niggers Z.
ate` Dr.
SCHULTZ His name is Django hes a free man and he can ride what he pleases.
SPENCER BENNETT Not on my.
property around my niggers he cant.
Dr.
SCHULTZ My good sir perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.
King Schultz this is my valet Django and these are our horses Fritz and Tony.
Fritz does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONYS surrounding Bennett giggle.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Mr.
Bennett Ive been lead to believe you are a gentleman and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that weve ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk with you now.
SPENCER BENNETT State your business.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.
SPENCER BENNETT You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee to buy one of my nigger gals no appointment no nuttin Dr.
SCHULTZ Im afraid so.
SPENCER BENNETT Well what if I say I dont like you or your fancy pants.

SCHULTZ Mr.
Bennett if you are the business man Ive been led to believe you to be I have five thousand things I might say that could change your mind.
i This gets everybodys attention not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.
ZG SPENCER BENNETT Cmon inside get yourself something cool to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter dismounts his steed as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Maybe while we discuss business you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.
SPENCER Absolutely.
Betina A pretty fleshy sweet jelled twentytwo year old slave gal named BETINA snaps to attention.
BETINA Yes sir Big Daddy SPENCER (TO SCHULTZ) Whats your Jimmies name again Dr.
SCHULTZ Django.
SPENCER Betina sugar take Django around the grounds.
Show em all the pretty stuff.
BETINA As you please Big Daddy.
Dr.
Schultz lowers his voice and says to the plantation owner; Dr.
SCHULTZ Mr.
Bennett I must remind you Django is a free man.
He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste he must be treated as an extension of myself.
SPENCER Understood.
Schultz.
Betina BETINA Yes sir SPENCER Django isnt a slave.
Django is a free man.
Do you understand Youre not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here cause he aint like any of these other niggers around here.
Ya got it BETINA Ya want I should treat em like white folks SPENCER No thats not what I said.
BETINA Then I dont know whatcha want Big Daddy.
SPENCER Yes I can see that.
(HE THINKS) Whats the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass His mama works at the lumber yard He comes by and fixes the windas when we have a problem The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in; MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR Oh you mean Jerry.
SPENCER Yeah thats the boys name Jerry.
(TO BETINA) You know Jerry dontcha sugar BETINA Yes em Big Daddy.
SPENCER Well thats it then.
just treat em like you would Jerry.
EXT ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR DAY Away from the big house Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up complete with handkerchief on her head and him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit are quite the pair.
She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.
BETINA Whatcha do for your massa DJANGO Didnt you hear him tell ya I aint no slave.
BETINA So you really free DJANGO Yes.
ZY BETINA You mean you wanna dress like that Django fumes.
EXT BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) DAY Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.
Schultz sit on the back porch drinking lemonade.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Ive beentold by those who should know the most exquisite African flesh in the state of Tennessee is bred right here on your land.
And from the look of these black angels my sources werent wrong.
SPENCER Oh I got my share of coal blacks horse faces and gummy mouth bitches out in the field.
But the lion share of my lady niggers are real show ponys.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Well thats what Im looking for a show pony for young Django.
So the only question that remains is do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars SPENCER Dr.
Schultz five thousand dollar nigger is practically my middle name.
BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it in the background.
DJANGO Betina come over here I need to ask you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy.
Betina thinks this fancy pants wants to get all loveydovey and she couldnt be less interested.
BETINA Whatcho want DJANGO Im lookin for three white men.
Three brothers.
Overseers.
Their name is Brittle.
Do you know em BETINA Brittle DJANGO Yes Brittle.
John Brittle.
Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle sometimes called Little Raj.
BETINA I dont know dem.
DJANGO They could be usin a different name.

BETINA You mean The Shaffers DJANGO Maybe Three brother BETINA Ahhuh.
DJANGO Are they here BETINA Ahhuh.
DJANGO Can you point one of em out to me BETINA Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field at a OVERSEER on top of a horse whip in hand eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it and takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.
Schultz.
He slides it open places it against his eye and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton field landscape.
SPYGLASS POV: Astride his nag the filthy hillbilly who calls himself SHAFFER but who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE looks on oblivious to Djangos observation.
DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a r into Broomhildas cheek with a BRANDING IRON.
BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS he lowers the glass.
3 0 BETINA (INNOCENTLY) Is that who you lookin for DJANGO Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up and puts it back in his purse.
DJANGO Wheres the other two BETINA.
They by the stable punishin Little Jody for breakin eggs.
DJANGO They whippin Little Jody She nods her head yes.
DJANGO Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed and keeps pointing right.
BETINA You go to that shed and keep goin that way.
Which means; Go to the shed and turn right.
DJANGO Go git that white man I came here with.
He slaps her ass to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed and begins crossing the distance between him and The Brittle Brothers.
FLASH ON A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his wife Broomhilda a peelin.
PEELIN : A punishment by bullwhip across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhildas back with his BULLWHIP.
DJANGO keeping behind the line begs Big John for mercy.
3/ DJANGO Please Big John she wont do it no more Shes real sorry The WHIP RIPS her back.
DJANGO (SCREAMING) Goddamit Big John LITTLE RAJ Whoa nigger calm down keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees and on behalf of Broomhild.
a begs Big John Brittle with everything he has.
BACK TO DJANGO crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers like an express train.
FLASH ON Big John Brittle standing over him bullwhip in hand saying to the KNEELING DJANGO; BIG JOHN BRITTLE I like the way you beg boy.
EXT STABLE DAY Little Raj Brittle ties LITTLE JODY a petite slave girl (eighteen) to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE Now Jody quit your caterwaulin.
You know yourself its for your own good.
Niggers are clumsy.
Youd break everything in goddamn sight you werent cured.
And the only known cure for nigger clumsiness is a peelin.
Little Jody begs to differ.
BACK TO DJANGO As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers he collects eight little friends who happily run along with the fast walking man.
EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH BULLDOGS who bark yelp snort and breath at his heels.
Django pays the little dogs no nevermind.
3 2 BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE In position to take the skin off of Little Jodys back.
BIG JOHN After this well see if you break eggs again.
DJANGO turns the corner to the stable and stands behind them.
They dont see him.
Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH.
WHEN.
DJANGOS VOICE stops him; DJANGO John Brittle Big John breaks his whip stride looks.
up and in a discarded full length broken mirror from the big house laying abandoned against the stable wall he sees DJANGO dressed in his powder blue satin Little Lord Flauntleroy outfit surrounded by his pack of little French Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees tied to the dead tree stump looks up sees the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django who he still doesnt recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears.
He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.
LITTLE RAJ Django Django crosses toward Big John raising up his arm like hes going to shake his hand.
DJANGO Remember me.
Django extends his arm and Dr.
Schultzs Derringer arm contraption.
POPS the TINY GUN into his hand and he FIRES a tiny bullet smack dab into BIG JOHNS MERCILESS HEART.
BIG JOHN FACE goes into shock.
he falls to his knees.
he looks up clutching his heart at Django.
DJANGO I like the way you die boy.
3 3 Big John hears it.
then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY cant believe what shes just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background see it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned.
then comes to his senses fumbling for the gun he wears on his hip but since hes no gunman in his haste he gets it out of his holster but drops it on the ground.
It goes off.
BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound.
of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big Johns WHIP off the ground.
and begins WHIPPING LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.
DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND whips him on the ground then throws the whip to the ground picks Rogers pistol off the ground and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted is a understatement.
Dr.
Schultz rides his horse up quickly rifle in his hand.
He sees Django and the two dead bodies.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Who are they DJANGO Thats John Brittle and thats his little brother Raj.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Wheres Ellis DJANGO Hes the one hightailin it across that field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying to make an escape.
SCHULTZS WINCHESTER goes to his eye he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Are you sure thats him Ellis gets further away.
DJANGO Yes Dr.
SCHULTZ Are you positive Ellis gets further away.
DJANGO I dunno.
Dr.
SCHULTZ You dont know if youre positive Ellis gets further away.
DJANGO I dont know what positivemeans.
Dr.
SCHULTZ It means youre sure.
DJANGO Yes.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes what DJANGO Yes Im sure thats Ellis Brittle.
BAM The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantations attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester) his SONS and his OVERSEERS and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.
Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Everybody calm down we mean no one else any harm SPENCER Just who the hell are you two jokers 35; Drï¿½.
SCHULTZ I am Dr.
King Schultz a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America.
The man to my left is Django Freeman hes my.
deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas for the arrest and capture dead or alive of John Brittle Ellis Brittle and Roger Brittle DJANGO They were goin by the name Shaffer.
Dr.
SCHULTZ You know them by the name Shaffer.
But the butchers real nameswere Brittle.
These are wanted men.
The law wants them for murder.
I reiterate this warrant states dead or alive.
When Django and myself executed these men on sight we were operating within our legal.
boundaries.
Now I realize passions are high.
But I must warn you the penalty for taking deadly force against a officer of the court in the performance of his duty is you will be hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mobs blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect.
Dr.
Schultz says; Dr.
SCHULTZ May I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it Resting his Winchester over his shoulder Bennett reaches for the paper.
SPENCER Gimmie.
Dr.
Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket and hands it to the plantation owner.
Bennett reads it silently to himself resigned to what it says.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.
SCHULTZ May I have that back 36 Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.
SCHULTZ We good BENNETT Get off my land.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Post haste.
(TO DJANGO) Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and lets get out of here.
TIME CUT All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them the white and black man start to ride out when Spencer Big Daddy Bennett steps in their way for one final threat.
BENNETT Aint nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie while you on my property.
But for lettin a nigger kill a white man and especially for letting a nigger kill a white man in a audience of niggers yall aint gonna make it out of the county alive.
Mark my words Schultz by tomorrow morning your niggers gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin from my motherfuckin gate.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Im fully aware Bennett that you and your regulator playmates arent shy about killing for what you believe in.
But mark my words Big Daddy if you make a move towards Django or myself you better be prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

SPENCERS POV: We see the camp by the lake that Dr.
Schultz and Django have set up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls.
The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers lie by them in a pile.
A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE CARING MEN observing the camp from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came.
Where about TWENTYFOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth holes cut out.
Some carry TORCHES all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse.
Big Daddy issues orders astride his steed.
SPENCER BENNETT Now unless they start shootin first nobody shoot em.
Thats way too simple for these jokers.
Were gonna whip that nigger lover to death.
And Im gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words he puts the flour sack over his head.
He tussles with the sack for a bit then from inside the sack; SPENCER BENNETT Damn I cant see fuckin shit outta this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.
eye holes and rips trying to make the holes bigger he only succeeds in makingvisibility more obscured.
BRADSHAW We ready or what 3 7 SPENCER BENNETT Hold on Im fuckin with my eye holes.

Spencer puts on his sack everyone else reluctantly does as well.
EXT LAKE NIGHT The THIRTY RIDERS all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS come riding over the hill hooting and hollerin.
Since nobody can see they ride haphazard into each other.
Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat ass.
They surround the camp and when the sleeping Schultz and Django dont react they know somethings up.
But since nobody can see everybody and everybodys horse is.
confused.
WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS: Where are they I cant see They tricked us Did somebody fall Where the hell are they Yall Redfish fell off his horseHes kinda hurt bad.
Then amongst the confusion.
WE SNAP ZOOM TO A BIG TREE on the other side of the lake Then quickly cut into The Tree.

Dr.
SCHULTZ Let em have it DJANGO I cant see nothin.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.
INSIDE OF THE SMOKE pandemonium reigns.
Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of bodies of horses and men.
Men with legs and arms blown off yell bloody murder hurt and scared Horses cry.
Some struggle to get the sacks off their heads while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire.
The rest of the men not blown up and still on horseback between the sacks and the smoke still cant see worth a damn.
And Men and Horses collide with one another which causes more bucking and riders falling.
About fifteen of the men who can still ride high tail it the fuck out of there.
Whipped and whimpering like dogs.
SPENCER BENNETT on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life.
SCOPE SIGHT POV We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.

They hop out of the tree.
MONTAGE Dr.
Schultz in a big city buying Django a new saddle.
Django gets his first initial D etched into it.
The men go to different stores to purchase Djangos wardrobe.
The outfit bought is selected by Django with suggestions offered by Schultz.
When hes done Django looks damn handsome in his new duds.
Brown cowboy boots Green Corduroy Jacket Smokey Grey Shirt Tan Skin Tight Pants and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a.
bit like Elvis in Flaming Star and a Little Joe Cartwright on Bonanza.
However tellingly he keeps Ace Specks Winter Coat as his winter coat.
EXT COUNTRY MEADOW PRETTY DAY Django sitting on his new saddle in his new duds rides alongside the good doctor Schultz.
The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.
SCHULTZ But Im serious son Greenville is just too dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
Youre a freed slave you should be in New York.
You shouldnt be in Greenville you shouldnt even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.
You shouldnt be anywhere in Mississippi.
DJANGO Shes my wife its my job to look after her.
If Greenvilles where I gotta go to find out where she went then I gotta go.
Now you were sayin where I gotta go first Dr.
SCHULTZ Thereshould be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold you know where she came from the Carrucan Plantation and you know her name.

Schultz reacts.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Broomhilda Django.
nods his head yes.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Were her owners German Now Django reacts How did he know that DJANGO Yeah how did you know She wasnt born on The Carrucan Plantation.
She was raised by a German mistress The Von Shafts.
She can speak a little German too.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Your wife DJANGO Yeah when she was little her mistress taught her so shed have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.
SCHULTZ So let me get this straight your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft.
DJANGO Yep.
Mouthful huh Dr.
SCHULTZ To say the least.
(stopping the horse) This looks like a very pretty place to have our picnic.
Whatd ya say here TIME CUT EXT PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW PRETTY DAY The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off and drinks a cup of tea.
DJANGO How did you know Broomhildas first masters were German Dr.
SCHULTZ Broomhilda is a German name.
If they named her it stands to reason theyd be German.
DJANGO Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda Dr.
SCHULTZ No not so much.
Broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of all the German legends.
DJANGO Really Theres a story bout Broomhilda Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes there is.
DJANGO Do you know it Dr.
SCHULTZ Every German knows that story.
Would you like me to tell you Django nods his head yes.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Well Broomhilda was a princess.
She was the daughter of Wotan the god of all gods.
Anyway her father is really mad at her.
DJANGO What she do.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I dont exactly remember.
I think she disobeys him in some way.
So at first hes just going to obliterate her DJANGO Obliterate.
what does that mean Dr.
SCHULTZ Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.
DJANGO Phew thats pretty mad.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes it is and like most fathers given a little time he calms down a bit.
Hes still mad at her.
He still wants to punish her.
Just not.
blow her up.
So instead what he does is he puts her high on top of a mountain.
DJANGO Broomhildas on a mountain Dr.
SCHULTZ Its a German legend theres always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.
So he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And.
then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.
DJANGO Does a fella arise From now on as Dr.
Schultz talks hes beginning to realize something he wasnt aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes Django as a matter he does.
A fella named Sigfried.
DJANGO Does Sigfried save her Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes he does and quite spectacularly so.
Now true he is assisted in his triumph by a truly truly remarkable sword still having said that Sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his sword but due to his courage.
He scales the mountain because hes not afraid of it.
He defeats the dragon because hes not afraid.
of him.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (CONT) He walks through hellfire because Broomhildas worth.
it.
After that last line of dialogue.
the two men just let a moment pass as they nibble on their sandwiches.
DJANGO I know how he feels.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I think Im just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot as he thinks about what hes going to say next.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Look Django I dont doubt one day you will save your lady love.
But Im afraid I cant let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question how do you like the bounty hunting business DJANGO Kill white folks and they pay ya Whats not to like Dr.
SCHULTZ I hafta admit we make a good team.
DJANGO But Ithought you were mad at me for killin Big John and Rodger Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes on that occasion you were a tad overzealous.
But normally thats a good thing.
Howd you like to partner up for the winter DJANGO Whatd ya mean partner up Dr.
SCHULTZ You be my deputy for real this time.
A lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs.
Some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece.
With one man anything over three men is a risk.
But with a partner Creating cross fire Its fish in a.
barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in thehills for the winter.
DJANGO You makin another agreement W7 Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes.
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts.
I give you a third of my bounties.
And while were together Ill teach you a few things youre going to need to know.
DJANGO Can you teach me how to make Tony do that head bow thing that Fritz can do Dr.
SCHULTZ That among other things.
We make some money this winter when the snow melts Ill take you to Greenville myself and well find where they sent your wife.
Im pretty good at finding people.
Is it a deal No white man has ever done anything for Django just to him.
So understandably hes a little suspicious.
DJANGO Why you care what happens to me Why you care if I find my wife Dr.
SCHULTZ Well frankly Ive never given anybody their freedom before.
And now that I have I feel vaguely responsible for you.
Youre just not ready to go off on your own its that simple.
Youre too green youll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried.
its kind of a big deal.
As a German Im obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and Schultz partner up as bounty hunters.
Schultz wears his normal ensemble.
Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket unless its really cold which a lot of this Montage is.
Then he still wears Ace Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.
WE SEE A SCENE to be improvised (more or less) where Dr.
Schultz teaches Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene after trial and error we see Djangos going to be good at this.
EXT HILLSIDE SUNNY DAY We see Django and Dr.
Schultz walking up a hill.
Tony and Fritz have been left tied up downhill.
Django leads a extra body HORSE (named PONCHO) behind him.
Dr.
Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in a long case.
They get to the top of the hill.
It overlooks a small farmhouse.
Y 8 DOWN BELOW WE SEE A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top Dr.
Schultz says; Dr.
SCHULTZ Keep down or hell see you.
DJANGO Who that farmer Who cares Dr.
SCHULTZ Well since we came here to kill em he just might.
DJANGO What The little man pushin that plow Dr.
SCHULTZ That little man pushing that plow is Smitty Bacall.
DJANGO Smitty Bacall is a farmer Dr.
SCHULTZ No.
Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber whos hiding out as a farmer because theres a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.
Dr.
SCHULTZ And hes all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly with the Scope Sight up to his eye.
SCOPE SIGHT POV: on the Farmer struggling behind his plow working hard with his horse and his son.

Dr.
SCHULTZ Put down the rifle.

Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Read it aloud.
Consider it todays lesson.
DJANGO (READING) Wanted dead or alive.
Smitty Bacall and The Smitty Bacall Gang.
For murder and stagecoach robbery.
Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall.
One thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as follows DANDY MICHAELS GERALD NASH and CRAZY CRAIG KOONS.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Well done.
Bravo.
THAT is who Smitty Bacall is.
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twentytwo they would never of printed that.
(REFERRING TO THE HANDBILL) But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches and he didnt mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what I do This is what I do.
I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.
His corpse is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesnt know what happened at first.
Then he figuresout his father was just shot.
He goes to him in the dirt.
Dr.
SCHULTZ You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.
DJANGO Why Dr.
SCHULTZ Its good luck.
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill to collect Smitty Bacalls body leading the extra body horse behind them.
50 As they walk down hill they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacalls Son cradling his dying father.
in his arms the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies.
Dr.
SCHULTZ See theyre having a tender little father son moment now.
No doubt the most heartfelt one theyve ever had.
EXT SNOWY FOREST NIGHT Its now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN hes built.

TNT SHERIFF GUSS OFFICE NIGHT The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them coffee.
After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid they get down to business.
As Schultz and Gus discuss the bounties Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall.
On the third one he reads WARREN VANDERS and a two thousand dollar bounty That one Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed we see theyve become a genuine bounty hunting team.
And Django a genuine bounty hunter.
EXT PRETTY MEADOW DAY The snow has melted and its SPRING.
And inside of this meadow Django practices his fast draw against five men.
by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air.
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins FIRES again hitting another then falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.
5L As Schultz collects the coins off the ground he says; Dr.
SCHULTZ Youre pretty confident arent you Django nods his head yes.
Dr.
SCHULTZ You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist opens his hand the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center.
He drops them on top of Django.
DJANGO Still think Im too green for Greenville Dr.
Schultz removes a pipe sticks it in his mouth and says; Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh youre ready for Greenville.
He lights a match then lights the pipe puffing as he says; Dr.
SCHULTZ Greenville ready for you that Im not so sure.
He blows out the match.
WE GO TO BLACK What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of slavery.
Django in his green jacket in his cowboy hat on top of his steed Tony with his gun hanging from his hip has become his own man.
Hes not a slave anymore.
Hes a bounty hunter.
BLACK TITLE CARD ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala Rocky and FLASHDANCE) MISSISSIPPI CUT TO EXT THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI DAY The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves and wagon wheels and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.
53 We see Django and Dr.
Schultz enter the town and slosh their horses in the mud down the main street of Greenville Mississippi.
The buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN WOMEN and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other move through the muddy streets of Greenville.
WHITE MEN on horses move them along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS) and pretty PONYS driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old) a shepherd leads a bunch of SLAVE CHILDREN through town.
A SHEPHERDS DOG HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen: GREENVILLE CHICKASAW COUNTY MISSISSIPPI Dr.
Schultz takes in this African flesh market where human beings sell other human beings with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or.
shocked he knows first hand how Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds he looksat the BLACK MEN half dressed: in chains.
He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other Companions from earlier being walked through the mud of Main Street by The Speck Brothers.
On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today with a gun on his hip money in his pocket in his snappy outfit astride his steed Tony he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot and across from it a huge SLAVE PEN like a STEER CORRAL.
At the moment theres no train in the depot.
WE FLASH ON The TRAIN at a earlier time pulling into the depot.
INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES Django watches the train pull into the station from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.
: A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN and TWO WHITE SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD) peer down at their human cargo.
JUDD Good god almighty these niggers stink I F RUSS Niggers stink wheres the shock (to the Slaves BELOW) Okay you bucks listen up and listen well Im only gonna say this once.
Theres a slave corral right across from this boxcar.
We gittin ready to open these doors.

Anyone gittin off trail gonna get hurt and hurt bad.
Now you niggers better comprehend.
And that goes for any African garboons amongst yall cant understand english.
your American buddies better shove your ass in the right direction or your trip to this country is going to be short and pointless.
Train to pen as fast as you can The boxcar door is slid open and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.
INSIDE THE CORRAL through the wooden posts in the distance Django watches them open up the boxcar holding the females.
They do their run to their pen out of view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.
a running with the other LADIES then shes gone from view.
BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT) Django and Dr.
Schultz on top of their horses taking in the sight of Greenville.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Its a spectacle out of Dante.
DJANGO You should see it from the other side.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Frankly I dont know if I could endure this.
DJANGO Youd be surprised what you can endure.
(BEAT) Where to 675 Dr.
SCHULTZ Records office.
CUT TO INT RECORDS OFFICE DAY Dr.
Schultz and Django walk into a records office lined with books.
We watch through the store front window the black man and white man enter and Dr.
Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking RECORDS OFFICE WORKER.
As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words routine.
The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.
BLACK TITLE CARD: BROOMHILDA INT SLAVE PEN DAY The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of the slave pen to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda as before is walked by in the distance.
Then as before Django loses sight of her.
EXT MAIN STREET GREENVILLE DAY We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO WHITE MALE SLAVERS.
Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud and the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything youve ever seen of Broomhilda has only been in Djangos Spaghetti Western Flashbacks.
In other words from his perspective and memory.
This is theonly time the story will shift to Broomhildas perspective.
The strong but frightened girl is led out on to the hustle and bustle and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django was sold in at the beginning.
Instead Shes just lifted up on a parked buckboard wagon.
Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.
BROOMHILDA looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men and holds her breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.
HARMONY (MIKE) not quite as ugly as the rest.
An older well dressed classy gentleman.
Next to him is his twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.
Scotty in the audience and Broomhilda on the wagon THEIR EYES MEET he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd.
Then her back revealing her whip marks.
Then pointing out the runaway r branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd including Scotty react with repulsion at the sight of the whip marks.
The Seller assures the crowd that niggers dont feel pain like white folks and it only makes the women more gentle.
SELLER CLYDE Fellahs you aint felt gentle till you felt nigger gal gentle.
UGLY MAN makes a bid.
BROOMHILDA yikes.
UGLIER MAN higher bid.
BROOMHILDA reacts.
UGLIER BY FAR GUY makes leap frog big bid.

A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

Mr.

Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into the back of the buckboard.
He hands her a little white bag.
SCOTTY This is for you.
She opens the bagcandies of many colors sit in it.
SCOTTY Theyre jelly beans.

We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the back eating her bag of jelly beans.
$XT COUNTRY ROAD DAY The buckboard makes its way down a country road.
Broomhilda in the back and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her but hes too scared to talk to her.
Broomhildas muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon.
Shes beginning to realize the young master is the shy type.
BROOMHILDA Master Scotty.

Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room.

He squeezes Broomhildas hand.
Candie sees this.
CALVIN CANDIE It would be.

Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are.
He brushes her off with a Dont be silly.
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple and they join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA whose dress is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk and the White Men have a forced good time.
But Calvin Candie cant hide his sinister side from Broomhilda and it keeps her uncomfortable until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed.
Scottys having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind.
Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff due to Scottys disobedience.
If these fancy.

SCHULTZS PERSPECTIVE We see Calvin Candie and his black slave.
bodyguard BARTHOLOMEW always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler hat among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candies lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
Dr.
SCHULTZ His name is Calvin Candle and he is the owner of Candyland.
DJANGO Candyland The mandingo fightin place Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh so you heard of it DJANGO Aint no slave aint heard of Candyland.

Dr.
SCHULTZ How much do you know about mandingo fighting DJANGO Not so much.
A little.
Master Carrucan had a couple niggers hed fight.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Can you play a mandingo expert DJANGO What Dr.
SCHULTZ Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters DJANGOÂ¢ Why Dr.
SCHULTZ Because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in Dixie but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males if WE want to get his attention we better be talking about big sweaty black males.
So my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game.
And your character is the mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.
DJANGO They call that OneEyed Charly.
Dr.
SCHULTZ.
OneEyed Charly DJANGO Thats what you call it when you buy a slave expert.
If you wanna raise horses but dont know nothin about horses you buy yourself a OneEyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya.
You wanna plant tobacco but dont know nothin about it you buy yourself a OneEyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Why do they call it OneEyed Charly 70 DJANGO You know back on the plantation my.

Dr.
SCHULTZ Testy.
Its an unusual name.
Thats a perfectly legitimate question.
So can you convincingly play my mandingo OneEyed Charly Dont say yes if you cant.
DJANGO You want me to play a black slaver There aint nothin lower then a black slaver.
Black slavers are lower then head house niggers and buddy thats pretty fuckin low.
Dr.

Django gets that.

Django wanders over the dining room and peers inside.
INT DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) NIGHT A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house.
The DINERS are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN and pretty BLACK GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day.

two men with two women.
Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white mens ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine and hearty beef driven American dining.
The dolled up decked outPonys eat rich French cuisine complete with elaborate sauces and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls usually eat ice cream with hot fudge banana splits and cookies.
Whileall the men drink whiskey or wine the girls all drink sarsaparilla.
Dr.
Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks; Dr.

Coco blushes.
MOGUY You better watch out doctor you gonna steal this little ponys heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room as they do they SAY; Dr.
SCHULTZ How long have you been associated with Mr.
Candie MOGUY Calvin and I were about eleven when we went to boarding school together.
One could almost say I was raised to be Calvins lawyer.
DJANGO One could almost say you a nigger.
Coco cant believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to Mr.
Moguy.
MOGUY What did you say Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh nothing hes just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.
Candie I should know before I meet him MOGUY Yes hes a bit of a Francophile.
7EF Dr.
SCHULTZ What civilized people arent MOGUY Thats why all the French ambiance.
And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.
Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; Dr.
SCHULTZ (FRENCH) What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy and he turns to warn Schultz.
MOGUY Oh he doesnt speak French.
Dont speak French to him itll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open.
The party enters the billiard room.
INT BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) NIGHT Inside is Calvin Candie his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in the ill fitting suit) and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also at this moment TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man whos rooting for the mandingo that Calvins not rooting for is also in the room.
His name is.
AMERIGO VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made with his back to the new arrivals and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life Calvin says; CALVIN CANDIE Why do you want to get in the mandingo business Thats quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.
Schultz says as if hes just been massively insulted; Dr.
SCHULTZ You dont intend to allow your 2nd.
(referring to Moguy).
to make the proper introductions Without turning towards them Candie tells Schultz; 7S CALVIN CANDIE Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.
Dr.
SCHULTZ The awful truth (PAUSE) Im bored and it seems like a good bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart.
Hell accept it for now.
CALVIN CANDIE Well come on over cause we gotta us a fight goin on thats a good bit of fun_ Dr.
Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING CHARACTER.
Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch.
the two men beat each other to death he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.
CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine.
I just bought him today.
Whats his name Moguy MOGUY Big Fred.
CALVIN CANDIE The other nigger belongs to this disreputable Italian gentlemen to my right.
Amerigo Vassepi.
(TO AMERIGO) Whats your niggers name AMERIGO Luigi.
Candie looks over at Django; who doesnt walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room.
A slave bartender named ROSCOE tends it.
CALVIN CANDIE How bout you boy You find nigger fightin a good bit of fun DJANGO You seen one nigger fight ya seen em all.
CALVIN CANDIE Howd you two like to try the signature drink of the club 79 Dr.
SCHULTZ Wed love to.
CALVIN CANDIE (yelling to the BARTENDER) Roscoe two Polynesian Pearl Divers and dont spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.
CALVIN CANDIE Arrivederci Luigi Well Mr.
Vassepi looks like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks.
They both take a sip.
Schultz hates it Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.
CALVIN CANDIE Whats your name boy Dr.
SCHULTZ His name is Django.
CALVIN CANDIE (TO SCHULTZ) Whered ya dig him up Dr.
SCHULTZ A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.
CALVIN CANDIE (TO DJANGO) Ive heard tell about you.
I heard youre a real bright boy.
(BEAT) Im curious what makes you such a mandingo expert DJANGO Im curious what makes you so curious Bartholomew puts down his pool cue and turns toward Django; BARTHOLOMEW What you say boy 77 /ï¿½.
Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomews shoulder.
CALVIN CANDIE Calm down Bartholomew gentle.
gentle.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Monsieur Candie I would appreciate it if you directed your line of inquiry to me.
CALVIN CANDIE Doc Im a seasoned slaver you are a neophyte.
Im simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.
SCHULTZ With all due respect Monsieur Candie I didnt seek you out for your advice.
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price.
I wasunder the impression when you granted me an audience it would be to discuss business.
CALVIN CANDIE No we werent talking business yet.
We were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here if I do business with you.
(POINTING TO SCHULTZ).
Im doin business with both of yall.
(POINTING TO DJANGO) He does the eyeballin you the billfold Dr.
SCHULTZ Well you dont make it sound too flattering but more or less yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.
CALVIN CANDIE (TO DJANGO) So Bright Boy.
Moguy here tells me you looked over my African flesh and were none too impressed.
FLASH ON we see.
Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS.
BACK TO CLEO CLUB DJANGO Not for top dollar.
CALVIN CANDIE Well then we got nothing more to talk about.
You wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me those are the beat ass niggers I wanna sell.
DJANGO He dont wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.
He wants the nigger you dont wanna sell.
CALVIN CANDIE I dont sell the niggers I dont wanna sell.
Dr.
Schultz chimes in thoughtfully; Dr.
SCHULTZ You wont sell your best.
You wont even sell your second best.
But your third best.
you dont want to.
sell him.
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous youd be forced to consider it.
who knows what could happen CALVIN CANDIE What do you consider ridiculous Dr.
SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen.
The Right Nigger.
: How much would you say Django DJANGO Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.
CALVIN CANDIE Gentlemen you had my curiosity.

Dr.
Schultz and Djangos eyes meet for a moment.

There you can get a look at my best specimens.

Dr.
SCHULTZ Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.
WE CUT EXT COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI DAY Its the next day and a whole procession is making their way to Candyland.
Calvin Candie Leonide Moguy Dr.
Schultz Django and THREE OVERSEERS (BILLY CRASH TOMMY GILES and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled withsupplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met plus JOSHUA SIDNEY JAMES and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction walk to their new home with small bundles of their personal possessions under their arm.
They look like powerful warriors.
THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY CHICKEN CHARLY CHESTER) WHO WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didnt sell at Greenville are walking back to Candyland with their small bundle of personal possessions under their arms.
These poor devils know their fate is pretty dismal.
Either theyll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company or theyll be put in some mandingo fight they cant win like with Samson or Stonesiphers dogs.
J RODNEY walks along the road looks up at Django riding his horse.
All the slaves hate Django because they think hes a black slaver.
But the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.
FLASH ON Django with Schultz earlier inspecting and rejecting these three.
RODNEY gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.
DJANGO ON TONY sees it.
Hes playing the role of a fucker black slaver he cant let that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man; DJANGO Gotta problem with your eyeball boy Rodney looks away.
RODNEY No sir.
DJANGO You want a boot heel in it RODNEY No sir.
DJANGO Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me Flash that bad look at me again Ill give ya reason not to like me As this parade makes progress Django keeps his emotions in check but not without difficulty.
Dr.
Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.
SCHULTZ How do you like this side of the slave trade DJANGO Not so much.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Prefer the other side DJANGO I didnt say that.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Ive confirmed Broomhildas at Candyland.
DJANGO Are you sure its her Dr.
SCHULTZ He didnt call her by name but shes a young lady whip marks on her back and speaks German.
Now while its not wise to assume in this instance I think its pretty safe.
DJANGO Did you offer to buy her Dr.
SCHULTZ I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally sight unseen I can only be so interested.
SUDDENLY.
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them.
CALVIN CANDLE Am I intruding Dr.
SCHULTZ Of course not.
CALVIN CANDIE (APPRAISING THE TWO MEN) I swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Youd be surprised what a good conversationalist Django is.
CALVIN CANDIE Oh by now I dont think that would surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
Dr.
SCHULTZ When do we reach your property 13 CALVIN CANDLE You been on it.
I own the whole sixty miles fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.
CALVIN CANDIE Excuse me a moment gentlemen.
(YELLING BEHIND him at Billy) Billy Crash git up here Billy Crash a hillbilly overseer whos missing his two front teeth rides up.
BILLY CRASH Yeah Boss CALVIN CANDIE Find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack BILLY CRASH Right away Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE You know confidentially just tween us girls worse things about this business aint the slaves.
Its all the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with us.
These dumb ignorant sleazy sonsabitches aint good fer nuttin except kickin a niggers ass cant kick back.
Yeah they holdin the pretty part of the whip but its just a thin membrane separate em.
And dont think they dont know it either.
Its about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know.
But ya need em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself.
But these mountain boys I use as trackers for the runaways they the worst.
Nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies.
Now like that nigger gal we was talkin bout.
Im sure it.
was a pain in the ass but with a lot of patience that German lady taught Hildi how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself.
His head does involuntary jerk but his ï¿½ emotions betray nothing.
PTE CALVIN CANDIE (CONT) Now these inbred hillbillies on the other hand they can barely speak English.
I cant understand a damn word most of em say.
You could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork.
I tell ya if it wasnt for catchin a nigger on the run theyd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.
CALVIN CANDIE What the hells goin on BILLY CRASH They got em a runaway.
CALVIN CANDIE Who CUT TO EXT TRACKER SHACK DAY A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel looks like a chicken coup sits next to the bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy bearded burly buck skinned wearing dirty long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.
STONESIPHER the other three are STEW LEX and JAKE.
The four men could be brothers or cousins or father and sons or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash.
Stew one SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash.
And Mr.
Stonesipher holds one SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash the lead dog that goes by the name of MARSHA.
A runaway slave named DARTAGNAN lies belly down in the dirt surrounded by the four vicious dogs who BARK GROWL and SNAP at him.
One look at DArtagnan tells you hes a mandingo whos been in one fight too many.
One of his eyes have been poked out.
Big BITES have been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights human bites notthe dogs) as well as three fingers have been bit off.
Not to mention hes covered in cuts like hes been drug through a briar patch.
O V5 The fourth Tracker JAKE doesnt engage in the melodrama.
He hangs in the background CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie Dr.
Schultz Django and the whole Candie caravan look down on the runaway slave.
Including the five new mandingos and the three old mandingos who know DArtagnan.
CALVIN CANDIE Well Ill be DArtagnan.
Now boy why do a fool thing like run off DARTAGNAN I cant fight no more Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE Oh yes you can.
You might not be able to win but your ass can fight.
Mr.
Stonesipher shut these goddamn dogs up I cant hear myself think Mr.
Stonesipher yells to Marsha; Mr.
STONESIPHER Hush now Marsha Marsha hush up Marsha Marsha hush up (to the other TRACKERS) Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger hes just makin em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.
CALVIN CANDIE How long was he loose Mr.

Mr.
STONESIPHER A.

Half the other night.
CALVIN CANDIE How far he git off property Mr.
STONESIPHER Bout twenty miles off prop.
Pretty fer considering that limp he got.
CALVIN CANDIE Moguy who was DArtagnan suppose to fight Friday.
MOGUY (pointing behind him) One of this new lot.
CALVIN CANDIE Well the way he looks now a blind Indian wouldnt bet a bead on em.
(TO DARTAGNAN) Boy you done made yourself as useless as a tail on a teddy bear.
DArtagnan starts begging.
CALVIN CANDIE Now now no beggin no playin on my soft heart.
You in trouble now son.
Now you need to understand Im runnin a business.
Now I done paid five hundred dollars for you.
And when I pay five hundred dollars I expect to get five fights outta a nigga fore he roll over and play dead.
Youve fought three fights.
DARTAGNAN I won every one.
CALVIN CANDIE Well yes you did.
But that last one you muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse and walks to the captured runaway on the ground.
CALVIN CANDIE But the fact remains I pay five hundred dollars I want five fights.
So what about my five hundred dollars You gonna reimburse me The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.
Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django.
hes seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos Rodney Chicken Charly and Chester watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candies treatment of DArtagnan to know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like poor bastard.
Calvin prods further.
CALVIN CANDIE You even know what reimburse means E 17 The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY.
The German Speaks; Dr.
SCHULTZ Ill reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.
Schultz.
Including Djangos whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the direction of the good German.
CALVIN CANDIE You will Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes.
CALVIN CANDIE Youll pay five hundred dollars for a one eyed OleJoe aint fit to push a broom Djangos voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.
DJANGO No he wont.
All eyes turn to Django.
DJANGO Hes just tiredof you toyin with him is all.
And for that matter so am I.
But we aint payin a penny for that pickaninny we aint got no use for em.
Aint that right Doc Dr.
Schultz realizes hes just done the one thing hes always preached to Django you can never do.
BREAK CHARACTER.
The doctor puts his billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (TO CANDIE) You heard em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the green jacket slack jawed.
` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.
CALVIN CANDIE Youll hafta excuse Mr.
Stonesiphers slack jawed gaze.
He aint never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.
Aint that right Mr.
Stonesipher Mr.
Stonesipher.
SPITS.
Mr.
STONESIPHER Thats right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse.
Looking up at the black man Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.
CALVIN CANDIE Well now since you wont pay a penny for this pickaninny you wont mind me handlin this nigger however I see fit DJANGO Hes your nigger.
CALVIN CANDIE Mr.
Ston.
esipher.

Mr.
STONESIPHER Marsha.

The DOGS CHARGE towards DArtagnan on his knees.
THE MANDINGOS all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK DARTAGNAN.
As we HEAR the ATTACK.
Candie.
staring contest with Django.
Django who expected nothing less and has seen worse doesnt blink as the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth.
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.
Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before and he appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin without blinking shifts his eyes toward Dr.
Schultz then back ï¿½.
to Django.
P9 CALVIN CANDIE Your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fightin As DArtagnans SCREAMS and Marshas GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.
DJANGO Naw he just aint use to seein a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
CALVIN CANDIE But you are use to it DJANGO Well him bein German an all Im a little more use to Americans then he is.
Now Monsieur Candie whenever youre ready we rode five hours so you could show off your stock.
Lets git to it.
Cause as of now if hes a example I aint impressed.
Calvin.
BLINK.
Saying nothing Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django climbs up on his horse then looks at the black man.
CALVIN CANDIE Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear DArtagnan apart.
EXT THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND DAY The caravan starts to approach Candyland.
Calvin Candie and his sister own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton and fields of SLAVES picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth Auschwitz Andersonville Yuma Prison a Mexican prison in a Sergio Corbucci Spaghetti western.
INSTEAD.
CANDYLAND is very beautiful.
The fields of cotton the way the trees hang green vines over everything.
Its full of nature and natures vibrant colors and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field DOBIE looks up and sees Django in his cool green corduroy jacket badass cowboy hat on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL) and points out Django.
90 All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field straighten up to get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.
EXT SLAVE VILLAGE DAY The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention and bow (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past.
A KING among his SUBJECTS a PATRON with his PEONS a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN a SHEPHERD among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name takes out a bag of jelly beans and begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element at his happiest.
THEN.
DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black its pretty much the same village.
And they too see Django.
WOW The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie family in the Big House) and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie who naturally leads the procession as if hes Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House it creates a huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvins widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIEFITZWILLY an attractive ï¿½.
fortyish strawberry blonde southern belle steps out on the porch of the Big House to greet her brother.
Directly above Lara Lee on the third floor balcony over hang out.
steps.
STEPHEN eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Whos STEPHEN Stephen is a very old black man who with his bald pate and tufts of white curly hair on the sides looks like a character out of Dickens if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum South.
Stephen has been Calvins slave since he was a little boy.
And in (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers evil scheming intriguing men always trying to influence and manipulate power for their own self interest.
Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.
THEN.
Out of the dust cloud.
EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ.
on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django dressed like he is up on the horse and for a moment dont know what to think.
Lara Lee like her brother is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket its hate at first sight.
Stephen heads downstairs he walks with a limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses.
Calvin sees Stephen limping towards them and greets him with a big how do you do; CALVIN CANDIE Hello Stephen my boy STEPHEN Yeah yeah yeah hello my ass whos this nigger up on that nag CALVIN CANDIE Oh Stephen why so ornery you miss me STEPHEN Yeah I miss you like I miss.

Your problem right now is making a good impression.
And I want you to start solving that problem right now and git them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master and says; STEPHEN Yes sir Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms muttering tohimself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow a FAT MAMMY named CORA comes up to her brother on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE Dr.
Schultz this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister may I present to you Lara Lee CandieFitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.
Schultz lifts his bowler hat and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I am Dr.
King Schultz this is my 2nd Django (Django tips his hat) and these are our horses Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.
Dr.
SCHULTZ And it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose.
LARA LEE Well arent you the charming gentlemen.
Youre not from around here are you Dr.
SCHULTZ Actually Im from a far off land Dusseldorf to be exact.

So I thought Id invite em down show em my stock.
LARA LEE Well all have dinner tonight right CALVIN CANDIE Half the reason I invited them.
I thought youd find.
them as intriguing as I do little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses a older one and two tough looking younger ones.
Theolder one is the Capt of the Overseers ACE WOODY and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY.
While Ace is dressed for work on a farm both Brown and Jingle Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach he turns to Dr.
Schultz and Django and says; CALVIN CANDIE You know since I started fightin niggers about eleven years ago its been a new lease onlife.
And the man ridin up here now is the man responsible for all my success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace Brown and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and Schultz.

Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle circling the black men with his horse.

AceWoody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie sitting comfortably up on his horse says; CALVIN CANDIE What do you think ACE WOODY I think you lookin for niggers to push a plow dem your boys.

Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip and SHOOTS Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head putting him out of his misery.
Moguy shakes his head Typical he thinks.
Django and Schultz on their horses next.

ACE WOODY Good job boy.

Ace gives Cody a slight head nod and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.
CALVIN CANDIE Now why did you do that ACE WOODY He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos 1 00 ACE WOODY (TO MANDINGOS) Those of you with exceptional ability will find it aint so bad here.

Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.
ACE WOODY Run em over to the Arena.
Git em doin push ups.
First one gives out shoot em in the head.
(TO MANDINGOS) Welcome to Candyland boys Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says; CALVIN CANDLE We only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy.
But those two tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE You know Mr.
Woody Im beginning to think that you dont trust my judgement Ace Woody just smiles at his boss and says; ACE WOODY Oh you know I always trust your judgement Boss Candie.
eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.
CALVIN CANDIE Ahhh Stephen my boy rooms ready STEPHEN All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candieshakes his head in mock frustration.
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen youre incorrigible.
(TO SCHULTZ AND DJANGO) Gentlemen let Stephen show you to your rooms.
/O+ CALVIN CANDLE (CONT) There you can lie down and rest up for a couple of hours.
Then well have some lemonade and Ill show off some of my finer specimens.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Splendid.
Both Dr.
Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.
CALVIN CANDIE Timmy boy go take their horses for em.
Fix em up at the stable give em a load of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.
DJANGO Thats Fritz this is Tony.
You take good care of em now.
TIMMY Yes sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag and hands it to the boy.
DJANGO Once hes in the stable give em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.
DJANGO Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms when Dr.
Schultz pretends to remember something; Dr.
SCHULTZ Oh Monsieur Candie about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about CALVIN CANDIE Nigger girl Dr.
SCHULTZ I believe you said she spoke German CALVIN CANDIE Oh Yes Hildi what about her oz.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room CALVIN CANDIE I dont see why not.
(TO STEPHEN) Stephen when you get through showing them to their rooms go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin nice and sent over to Dr.
Schultzs room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.
STEPHEN Actually.
Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE What STEPHEN Hildis in The Hot Box.
This gets Djangos Schultzs and Candies attention.
CALVIN CANDIE Whats she doin there STEPHEN What cha think she doin in The Hot Box she bein punished.

CALVIN CANDIE Jesus Christ how many people ran away when I was gone STEPHEN Two.
CALVIN CANDIE When did she go STEPHEN Last night.
They brought her back this morning.
CALVIN CANDLE How bad did Stonesiphers dogs tear her up Djangos hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon.
If they sicked those dogs on his angel hes going to just kill all these motherfuckers right now.
STEPHEN Lucky for her they were busy lookin for DArtagnans ass.
Brown and Cody went out lookin for her and found her.
She a little beat up but she did that to herself.
Runnin through them damn bushes.
Djangos hand moves away from his gun.
CALVIN CANDIE How long she been in the box STEPHEN Whatcha think all goddamn day Little fool got ten more days to go.
CALVIN CANDLE Take her out.
STEPHEN (INCREDULOUS) Take her out Why CALVIN CANDLE Because I said so thats why.
Hildi is my nigger.
Dr.
Schultz is my guest.
Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.
STEPHEN But Monsieur Candie she just ran away CALVIN CANDLE Jesus Christ Stephen whats the point of havin a nigger speaks German ifyou cant wheel em out when you have a German guest I realize its inconvenient.
Still take her out.
(to Cora and LARA LEE) Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and presentable for Dr.
Schultz The overseersTommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.
Box.
While Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.
Schultzs eyes shift to Django to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Djangos interest in both The Hot Box and whoevers sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma Prison) built into the ground.
They put a key in the lock and the two men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.
WHEN.
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGOS POV:.
From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.
REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGOS FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.
STEPHEN (TO DJANGO) You comin or you wanna sleep in that little box Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and Dr.
Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.
INT THE BIG HOUSE DAY Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of The Big House.
Then down the hallway with the guest rooms.
Dr.
Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen.
Schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him.
Stephen takes Django to the room next door opens the door and leads him in.
INT DJANGOS GUEST ROOM DAY A guest room with a big feather bed dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it.
A little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it.
105 STEPHEN This ones yours boy.
That beds damn nice too.
Django walks over to the window parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhildas gone.
As he looks through the glass snotty Stephen rattles on in the background.
STEPHEN Feel free to touch anything you want cause we burnin all this shit once you gone.
Ill have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.
DJANGO Not so fast.
STEPHEN I got more important things to do then jaw with you.
DJANGO Nigger when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead.
He turns around.
DJANGO This tiny bell on this little table.
is this for you I ring this you do fer me STEPHEN Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DINGALING STEPHEN (UNAMUSED) What cha want DJANGO I want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what hes told but with attitude.
)O Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephens done Django stands up from the bed.
DJANGO Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephens face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.
DJANGO Whatsamatter Stephen you dont like that Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor; DJANGO Thats my kinda bell ringin.
Git up.
The old man timidly slowly and shaky rises off the floor as soon as he does Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed looking at the old man on the floor below his knees.
DJANGO Ive known me House Niggers like you my whole life.
Play your dog tricks with your Massa.
Ya lip off to him every now an then as long as ya keep it funny.
He rolls his eyes and puts up with it and all the white folks think its so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin and jumpin to stay on your good side.
Well this time Snowball you gonna listen to me.
You got anymore sass you wanna sling my way before they give us a mandingo demonstration Im gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration of ME beatin the BLACK off your ass.
I will make you drop your drawers Ill take off my belt and I will Wup your bare ass with it in front of every nigga on this plantation.
And after I do that lets see you play the rooster round here.
X07 STEPHEN Calvin wouldnt.
let you do it.
DJANGO Oh thats right he gives you first name privileges.

Sass me me again nigger see what happen.
Stephen lying on the floor bites his tongue.
DJANGO Thats what I thought.
Now git outtahere.
With as much dignity as he can muster Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves Django tells him; DJANGO When I ring this bell you better come a runnin.
You not nobody else.
While Im on this property you my nigger Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed.
He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultzs room.
The adjoining door opens and Schultz stands there.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Was that wise Django doesnt remove his arm from.
his eyes.
DJANGO He aint tellin nobody bout that.
Thats all that needs to be said.
INT HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) DAY Lara Lee Cora and a traumatized but cleaned up (shes dressed in a domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.
Schultzs door after Calvins sister raps on it.
Dr.
Schultz opens the door.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Hello ladies.
DOG LARA LEE Dr.
Schultz may I introduce to you Hildi.
Hildi this is Dr.
Schultz he speaks German.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (TO BROOMHILDA) Ive been informed you do as well.
BROOMHILDA (GERMAN) It would be my pleasure to speak with you in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Laras astonishment.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Astonishing.
(IN GERMAN) Please come inside Fraulein.
She does and justas Lara Lee is to say something Schultz says Thank You very much and closes the door in her face.
Miss Lara looks to her Mammy and the two women head off nonplussed.
INT SCHULTZS GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) LATE AFTERNOON With the door closed Schultz turns to the weak frightened disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.
Dr.
SCHULTZ They call you Hildi but your real name is Broomhilda isnt it BROOMHILDA Yes.
How do you know that Dr.
SCHULTZ Stands to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water Broomhilda Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile not to mention with a German accent does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened girl.
107 WE CUT TO DJANGO on the other side of the adjoining door listening waiting for his cue to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.
SCHULTZ As Dr.
Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water he begins talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) Im aware you havent spoken German in a long while.
So Ill talk slowly.
Im only speaking German to you now Broomhilda in case Candies people are listening to us.
Myself and a mutual friend of ours have gone through a lot of trouble and rode a lot of miles to find you fraulein to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird rescue me Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (.
GERMAN).
Now its myself and our mutual friends intention to take you away from here forever.
BROOMHILDA (GERMAN) I dont got any friends.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) Yes you do.
BROOMHILDA (GERMAN) Who Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) I cant tell you.
Our mutual friend has a flair for the dramatic and he wants to surprise you.
0 BROOMHILDA (GERMAN) Where is he He points at the adjoining door.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman; Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) Promise me you wont scream She nods her head yes.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (GERMAN) Say I promise.
BROOMHILDA (GERMAN) I promise.
Dr.
Schultz moves to the door and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing.
Her husband Django but different all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her and says; DJANGO Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock.
first she loses strength in her wrist so the glass tips over and the water spills on the floor.
followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead.
faint.
1/1 The two men look at the woman on the floor then at each other; Dr.
SCHULTZ You silver tongued devil you.
MONTAGE WE DISSOLVE to later as we see Dr.
Schultz and Django explain what theyre doing there who theyre pretending to be and what their plan is to Broomhilda.
We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the soundtrack.
Its not a happy tune.
per se.
But its pretty and vaguely optimistic.
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN The doomed men who didnt sell at Greenville brooding Rodney and Chester and Chicken Charly spend their last night at Candyland sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen.
The same whistling tune continues over this scene.
Rodney sees The whole slave selling and buying group Django Dr.
Schultz Candie Bartholomew Moguy Ace Woody Brown and Cody and the Overseers walk across the plantation grounds on their way to The Arena.
Laughin and joshin all the way.
The hatred Rodney feels for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.
DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE in the dining room of The Big House with its knives spoons and forks.
Shes all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune weve been listening to has been coming from Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.
STEPHEN What you.
whistlin girl Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephens direction.
STEPHEN What was you whistlin BROOMHILDA Oh nuttin.
STEPHEN You werent whistlin nothin you were whistlin somethin.
Whatcha whistlin BROOMHILDA I dunno.
Somethin I heard.
I dont know no.
name.
)/Z STEPHEN Its kinder pretty.
She doesnt say anything in return.
STEPHEN That was a compliment.
BROOMHILDA Thank you.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.
STEPHEN Im just sayin two days ago you wus in such misery here you hadda run off.
So you run off we catch your ass an drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in The Hot Box for bout ten hours.
Now here you are two days later whistlin while you work.
Im just sayin I.
wouldn think youd have a hellva lot to whistle bout.
Im jus sayin.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhildas face.
BROOMHILDA Im done here may I be excused STEPHEN Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.
INT DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT Later that evening Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin Candie Lara Lee Moguy and Dr.
Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people weve come to know at Candyland (Stephen Cora and because Dr.
Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Djangos a slaver and for his dinner table privileges the Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in midnegotiation.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Look Monsieur Candle they were all fine specimens no doubt about it.
But the best three by far were Sampson Goldie and Eskimo Joe.
By the way whys he called Eskimo Joe CALVIN CANDIE Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started.
His name was Joe.
maybe one day he said he was cold.
who knows Dr.
SCHULTZ Irregardless we all know Samsons your best and youll never sell him and I can see why hes a champion.
CALVIN CANDIE All three are champions.
Django contradicts as he chews his steak; DJANGO Samsons the champion.
The other two are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda whos wielding the Gravy Boat.
After Django says that while in shock she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lees mashed potatoes.
LARA LEE Hildi Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry Candle seems to reflect on that analysis then issues his own appraisal; CALVIN CANDIE Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson no.
Can he take Goldie probably not Goldies the best dirty fightin nigger I ever saw.
But as long as you dont put em up against those two.
Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.
DJANGO Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.
// F Dr.
SCHULTZ You must understand Monsieur Candie while admittedly a.
neophyte in the nigger fight game I do have a bit of a background in the European traveling circus.
Hence I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache.
A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to.
bill.
him as.
The Black Hercules.
I said.
and I quote; I would pay top dollar for the right nigger.
Now Im not saying Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger per se.
but is he right as rain.
Everyone waits for Calvins response.
He milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep then says; CALVIN CANDIE Dr.
Schultz i will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then Monsieur Calvin J.
Candie.
But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.
(BEAT) A nigger that can win fights.
That should be your first second third four and fifth concern.
After you have that and you know you have that then you can start to implement a grande design.
But since I enjoy oldest man at the table status beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.
Schultz says something pleasant to her in German.
She smiles and says something pleasant back.
CALVIN CANDIE I see you two gettin on Dr.
Schultz breaks into a wide grin; Dr.
SCHULTZ.
Famously.
(DRAMATIC PAUSE) Monsieur Candie you cant imagine what its like not to hear you native tongue for four years.
CALVIN CANDIE Hell I cant imagine two weeks in Boston.
Â»5 Everybody at the table chuckles.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I cant express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.
And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy Lara Lee notices how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.
LARA LEE I dont know doctor you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is but when she said it all three Django Broomhilda and Schultz involuntarily jerk.
AND.
STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen.
Stephen watches her go then looks at Django then hands Candie his mint julep and goes into a broad routine for the tables benefit.
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen youre amazing.
I havent finished a drink in this house in twenty years.
STEPHEN When a man likes a cold drink a man likes a COLD drink.
Chuckle.
chuckle.
CALVIN CANDIE Did you overhear that joke I said about me spending two weeks in Boston STEPHEN (MOCK INDIGNANT) You dont have any idea the work I do to see food gets on the table.
1/6 CALVIN CANDIE What does that hafta do with the price of Tea in China STEPHEN You think when Im in that kitchen I got nothin better to do then listen in here to you tellin unfunny jokes Chuckle.
chuckle.
CALVIN CANDIE (MOCK INDIGNATION) What They laughed STEPHEN Of course they laughed their parents raised them right.
When theyre a guest in somebodys house and the master of of the house thinks hes funny you suppose to laugh.
Theyd be rude not to.
Chuckle.
chuckle.
They play their little comedy routine for all its worth.
CALVIN CANDIE No it was really funny (TO TABLE) wasnt it STEPHEN Now what do you expect these people to say What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest.
(TO TABLE) Everybody dont laugh at him youre being polite I understand you mean well but it just encourages him.
Chucklechuckle.
As the white folks chuckle Stephen moves back into the kitchen.
TNT KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT Once Stephen enters the kitchen his smile melts away and he locks eyes on Broomhilda.
He moves over to her.
STEPHEN You know that nigger /ï¿½ She spins around.
11 7 BROOMHILDAÂ¢ Who STEPHEN Dont stall me bitch you know who BROOMHILDA At the table I dont know him.
STEPHEN.
You dont know him BROOMHILDA No.
STEPHEN You wouldnt lie to me now would you She shakes her head no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.
STEPHEN Okay if you say so.
BACK TO DINNER TABLE Pick it up again in midnegotiation.
DJANGO Eskimo Joes a quality nigger no doubt about it.
But if it was my money I wouldnt pay twelve thousand dollars for him.
Dr.
SCHULTZ What would your price be DJANGO Well if I was inclined to be generous.
and I dont know why I would be inclined to be generous.
nine thousand.
maybe.
Candies lawyer chimes in.
MOGUY But the real question is not how much he cost but how much he can earn Dr.
SCHULTZ Django DJANGO In a years time seven or eight fights outside of Mississippi where his Candyland pedigree werent well known Virginia.
(CONT) 11Y DJANGO (CONT) Georgia all goes well.
twenty to twenty one thousand dollars.
CALVIN CANDIE Precisely Bright Boy good on ya.
Any way you cut that cake that spells profit.
Not to mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger.
However let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasnt me who came to you to sell a nigger it was you who approached me to buy one.
Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about aint too far off from right.
And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that I could sell em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor I dont wanna sell em.
It was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.
Schultz considersCalvin Candies words then suddenly says; Dr.
SCHULTZ You know Monsieur Candie.
you do possess the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand and says; Dr.
SCHULTZ Why not Monsieur Candie you have a deal Eskimo Joe twelve thousand dollars The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.
Schultz continues; Dr.
SCHULTZ However that is a tremendous amount of money.
And the way you have your Mr.
Moguy I have a lawyer a persnickety man named Tuttle.
And I would need my man to draw up a legal contract before I would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing.
So say I return in about five days time with my Mr.
Tuttle.
And then my Mr.
Tuttle and your Mr.
Moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves.
117 CALVIN CANDIE Splendid.
(CALLING TO THE KITCHEN) Stephen time for dessert Stephen Cora Broomhilda and the other Domestics come out of the kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.
BROOMHILDA Can I take away your dishes Monsieur Candle CALVIN CANDIE Yes you may Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.
CALVIN CANDIE So Hildi how you like servin at the big table in the big house BROOMHILDA I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.
CALVIN CANDIE Its a lot better then sizzling in that hot box or draggin your ass through a bramble bush aint it BROOMHILDA Yes em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Djangos reaction.
STEPHEN You know Monsieur Candle the doctor might be interested in seein Hildis peeled back.
Seein as he dont see many niggers where he from.
CALVIN CANDIE (TO SCHULTZ) When you was alone with Hildi here didja just speak German or did ya git her clothes off 20 Dr.
SCHULTZ We just spoke.
CALVIN CANDIE So you havent seen her back Dr.
SCHULTZ No I havent.
CALVIN CANDIE Then Stephens right you would probably find this interesting.
Hildi take off your dress and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.
LARA LEE Calvin I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.
CALVIN CANDIE But Lara Lee Dr.
Schultz is from Dusseldorf they dont got niggers there.
And hes a man of medicine.
Im sure it would fascinate him the niggers endurance for pain.
I mean Hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back.
Lara Lee get one shed lose her mind.
These niggers are tough no doubt about it.
LARA LEE Calvin we are eating dessert no less.
Aint no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.
CALVIN CANDIE Okay okay Lara.
Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda dismissed takes Calvins dishes and heads back into the kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django and follows Broomhilda behind the kitchen door.
121 INT KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS Stephen says to Broomhilda; STEPHEN I thought you said you didnt know him Broomhilda turns around.
BROOMHILDA Huh Stephen approaches her the other Domestics get quiet and watch.
STEPHEN I said you said you didnt know him BROOMHILDA I dont.
STEPHEN Yes you do.
BROOMHILDA Mister Stephen I dont.
STEPHEN Why you lyin to me As tears begin to well in her eyes.

STEPHEN Why am I scarin you BROOMHILDA Because youre scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.
Schultz in the next room say; Dr.
SCHULTZ (OS).

Stephen hears this hes starting to get the idea.
1ZL His eyes to to Broomhilda.
STEPHEN You stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door swings it open and watches Dr.
Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda.
Stephen knows these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something and now hes just figured it out.

Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.
CALVIN CANDIE Well as you can see talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen from time to time adult supervision is required.
If youll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.
TNT LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie.
Walls of perfectly bound books.
Stuffed animal heads (deer boar) that hes shot sit mounted on the walls.
Theres comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room sees Stephen sitting in the chair drinking his brandy and doesnt bat an eye.
It appears in this room Calvins and Stephens life long friendship exits on a different plane.
Outside of outside eyes in this room all pretense of master and slave is dropped and the number one and number two.

A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.
STEPHEN Now look you knew and I knew there was something up with these two.
We just didnt know what.
But now we do.
They dont want you to know how bad they want that girl.
But these ole boys have rode a lotta miles went t6 a whole lotta trouble and done spread a whole lotta bull to get this girl.
They must want her mighty bad.
Way I see it aint nothin changed.
They wanna buy a nigger you wanna sell a nigger.
The only thing done changed is the advantage.
(BEAT) Now we got it.
So lets go back in there and busts these motherfuckers chops.
INT DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara LeeCandieFitzwilly hold court melodramatically.
Till.
Calvin Candie enters the room from the kitchen door.
Lara Lee oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor blurts out upon SEEING HIM; LARA LEE There you are I was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their hosts demeanor as he stares down the table at them.
CALVIN CANDLE Thatd be a hellva note wouldnt it Lara Lee (CONT) 1Z J CALVIN CANDIE (CONT) Lara Lee I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woodys out there dealin with some shady slaver sellin a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball.
That of boy knows everything to know bout mandingos But he dont know diddly bout black puddin.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room as she goes out Bartholomew with his Sawed Off Shotgun comes.
in behind Schultz and Django.
CALVIN CANDIE Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder Schultz and Django do and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back and in his hand hes holding a big ugly hammer.
CALVIN CANDIE Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.
CALVIN CANDIE Now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top Bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
Theres been a lotta lies said around this table tonightbut that.
you can believe.
(BEAT) Mr.
Moguy would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin on those boyships Mr.
Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand Candie continues to hold court.
CALVIN CANDIE Now where were we Oh yes I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
Right Dr.
SCHULTZ Right.
CALVIN CANDIE (YELLING TO STEPHEN) Stephen Bring out Hildi Ix Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door holding roughly in his grip Broomhilda.
He holds a small Derringer pistol against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.
CALVIN CANDIE Now it should be quite clear by now I know youre not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason yall came to Candyland is yall want Broomhilda.
But yall dont want me to know how much you want er.
So instead you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe horseshit.
(TO STEPHEN) Stephen put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguys old chair.
With their palms against the table unarmed Django and Schultz silently watch Candies next move.
Candie still holding the hammer continues.
CALVIN CANDIE Now the way I see it aint nothin changed.
You still wanna buy a nigger I still wanna sell one.
So with that in mind in Greenville Dr.
Schultz you yourself said For the Right Nigger youd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount.
To which me myself said What is your definition of ridiculous To which you said Twelve thousand dollars.
Now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles went to a whole lotta trouble and done spread a whole lotta bull to purchase the lovely lady to my left it would appear that Broomhilda is The Right Nigger.
And if yall wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda the price is twelve thousand dollars.
Dr.
SCHULTZ I take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.
CALVIN CANDIE Under the laws of Chickasaw County Broomhilda is my property.
And I can do anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table making everybody jump.
IN CALVIN CANDIE And if you think my price for this nigger is too steep what Im gonna desire to do is take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it.
Right in front of both yall.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhildas sitting in.
CALVIN CANDIE Put up or shut up Schultz.
You wanna save this nigger bitch you gonna pay my price.
Dr.
SCHULTZ May I lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold CALVIN CANDIE Yes you may.
Dr.
Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit jacket and says; Dr.
SCHULTZ Easy come easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie.
The plantation owner takes out the money does a quick count then looks down the table at the seated Schultz and says; CALVIN CANDIE Pleasure doin business with you.
TIME CUT INT DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) NIGHT INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhildas BILL OF SALE.
Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django and watches her Master sign her freedom papers.
Dr.
Schultz sits off by himself.
Hes very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate Candies successes with glasses of Brandy.
Lara Lee Ace Woody and Brown and Cody have joined the celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend.
He just sold a Pony with a tore up back and a runaway r burned in her cheek aint worth five hundred dollars for twelve thousand.
Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him.
CALVIN CANDIE (TO SCHULTZ) Rhubarb pie Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
Dr.
SCHULTZ No.
CALVIN CANDIE Are you brooding bout me getting the best of ya Dr.
SCHULTZ Actually I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today DArtagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs.
Broomhildas bill of sale and her freedom papers.
As he says the following he examines he papers.
CALVIN CANDIE Dumas.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas.
He wrote The Three Musketeers.
I figured you must be an admirer.
You named your slave after that novels lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today I wonder what he would of made of it CALVIN CANDIE You doubt hed approve Dr.
SCHULTZ Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
CALVIN CANDIE Soft hearted Frenchy Dr.
SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas is black.
1 30 Schultz rises puts the papers in his back pocket.
looks to his two companions Django and Broomhilda and says; Dr.
SCHULTZ We got it lets go.
(TO CANDIE) Normally Monsieur Candie I would say auf wiedersehen.
But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is till I see you again and since I never wish to see you again to you sir I say goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the Germans back; CALVIN CANDIE One more moment Doc Dr.
SCHULTZ What CALVIN CANDIE Its a custom here in the South once a business deal is concluded for the two parties to shake hands.
It implies good faith.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Im not from the South.
He turns to leave.
CALVIN CANDIE Youre in my house doctor Im afraid I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Insist what.
That I shake your hand before I leave Then Im afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.
CALVIN CANDIE You know what I think you are Dr.
SCHULTZ What you think I am No I dont.
1310 CALVIN CANDLE I think you are a bad loser.
Dr.
SCHULTZ And I think youre an abysmal winner.
CALVIN CANDLE Never the less here in Chickasaw County a deal aint done till the two parties have shook hands.
Even after all this paper signin dont mean shit you dont shake my hand.
Dr.
SCHULTZ If I dont shake your hand youre gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars.
I dont think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Lets go.
CALVIN CANDIE Bartholomew if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand.
Cut er down.
Schultz looks to Django.
then to Candle.
and then with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye asks CANDLE; Dr.
SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand Django gets it.
CALVIN CANDIE I insist.
DR Schultz smiles.
Dr.
SCHULTZ Well if you insist.
Django goes to stop him.
1 714 The German crosses toward Candie offering him his hand.
Candie offers his hand to Schultz.
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultzs outstretched hand.
POP He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart and he falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.
Dr.
SCHULTZ (TO DJANGO) Im sorry.
I couldnt resist.
Dr.
SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomews SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.
FADE TO BLACK We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see: The soles of Djangos bare feet.
A rope is tied around the ankles and its obvious hes been strung up upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body down his legs (we see his wrists arebound with ropes to his thigh) down his bare buttocks down his whip scarred back to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.
INT BARN AFTERNOON Eight year old stable boy Timmy wipes the unconscious Djangos face with a wet rag.
They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to.
TIMMY (SHHHS HIM) Act like you still sleepin.
DJANGO Wheres Broomhilda TIMMY Who DJANGO Hildi the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago.
They had her in The Hot Box.
TIMMY I dont know bout no girl.
DJANGO How bout that German white man I came here with TIMMY Oh hes dead.
His bodys over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope and sees the corpse of his friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor.
The sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace Timmy hightails it out of there Ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy.
ACE WOODY Git on outta here boy 133 Django slightly.
swaying to and fro from the rope looks upside down at Ace Woody all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie which makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.
ACE WOODY So yall bounty hunters.
huh Django thinks How does he know ACE WOODY I knew there was something fishy bout yall.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags.
I gotta say aint never heard of no black bounty hunter before.
A black boy paid to kill white men How did ya like that line of work Django retorts upside down.
DJANGO Well it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.
ACE WOODY Boy people round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool and sits down on it a body length from the hanging man.
ACE WOODY See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure round here.
Now hes dead as fried chicken everyone round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his waist he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina shoulder holster.
He removes the big blade from its sheath.
ACE WOODY Yep Boss Mans gone.
Poor Calvin.
Poor goddamn Calvin.
Were burnin him in a few hours.
At sunset.
Should be real pretty.
However.
I dont think youre gonna be able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT.
IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor four inches from Djangos face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and Django pulls the blade out of the floor and walks back to his stool and sits back down.
As he does this he says; ACE WOODY Now I understand you didnt really have nuttin to do wit it.
Its that German sunbitch the trouble maker.
You just wanted to git your girl and hightail your nigger asses outta here.
Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks round here need someone to blame.
And I guess they figure if you hadnt brought your black ass round here in the first place Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again.
this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Djangos face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says; ACE WOODY Now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways believe me when I.
tell you I know every goddamn trick in the book.
Now theres a lotta ass busters out there try an git creative with the way they bust ass.
But me.
I always found the best methods are tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again.
Django JERKS his head back.
and the knife LANDS in the floor right where Djangos head was.
Ace Woody stands up walks the floor to the Bowie yanks it out of the wood.
and straightens up standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man.
Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his mercy.
ACE WOODY You know Blackie here at Candyland I had me a real sweet deal.
These last eleven years training Calvins mandingos I made me more money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight neither.
(BEAT) Then you came along.
Knocked me right off that perch I was sittin pretty on.
You think Miss Lara gonna be as.
interested in mandingos as her brother Uuummmm.
I dont think so.
What I think is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you Django boy you could say I gotta axe to grind.
IJS He grabs a handfull of Djangos genitals in his fist.
He takes his big Bowie and places the razor sharp BLADE against Djangos nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.
ACE WOODY Hows the blade of that Bowie feel against your ball sack Blackie A Bowie right off the wet stone.
Now thats what I call sharp.
Django dances some more.
ACE WOODY Yep nigger Im gonna snip them nuts.
(BREATH) On the count of three.
DJANGO SCREAMS: DJANGO NO ACE WOODY ONE.
DJANGO NO DONT DO IT ACE WOODY Got to do it boy.
TWO.
DJANGO NO Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith facility.
Hes holding Djangos clothes in a bundle under his arm.
STEPHEN Capt Miss Lara lookin for you.
She wanna talk about the Old Mans funeral.
Oh and she changed her mind bout snippin Django.
She gonna give em to the LeQuint Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Djangosjunk Ace Woody says; ACE WOODY Well she didnt waste a minute tellin me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django both men get over the aborted emotion of what almost happened.
ACE WOODY (TO DJANGO) How disappointing.
171 ACE WOODY (TO STEPHEN) Where she at STEPHEN She in the big house.
The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the blacksmith barn and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in the fire.
Djangos clothes are dumped by the furnace.
ACE WOODY You gonna look after our friend As he plays with the poker in the fire he says; STEPHEN Oh yes sirree Bob you know I am 01 Snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know gonna have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire its RED HOT END GLOWS ORANGE.
STEPHEN Snowballs just makin sure his talking stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker and naked bound upside down Django alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked hanging Django.
STEPHEN I bet you an that German thought yall was on easy street for awhile didnt ya Yall track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville look up the Ole Man there.
(BREATH) That was a good idea.
I bet yall couldnt believe how easy it was.
You meet Moguy he buys your horseshit.
Ya git your ass invited to Candyland no fuss no muss.
Ya ride the whole way to the plantation no one the wiser.
Then ya ride in to Candyland ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking Big House.
137 STEPHEN (BEAT) And thats where you met me.
And thats when you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Djangos NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie heros Django doesnt take torture silently and stoically.
This shit fucking hurts so you best believe he screams his fucking ass off and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange tip of that red hot poker.
STEPHEN Now that fancy talkin white man of yours didnt know whats what.
He still thought his ass hadda chance.
But like the OneEyed Charly you are you always know the end is near fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker he BURNS OFF Djangos other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air.
Stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils.
STEPHEN Damn Nigger you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.
STEPHEN You know when you was sittin on that feather bed in the quest room in the Big House After you slapped my ass to the floor You were sayin something bout my BARE BLACK ass and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that Bright Boy He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Djangos BARE buttocks.
Django SCREAMS Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire.
He goes through Djangos clothes and pulls out his tan pants.
He tosses them on the floor by the hanging man.
STEPHEN You leavin thats what you can take with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man and as he talks to him he begins fondling Djangos genitals.
I31 STEPHEN Now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours.
Seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life was comin up with different ways to kill your ASS.
Now most of dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts.
But while that might SEEM like a good idea.
Truth is once ya snip a niggers nuts most bleed out.
Then I say; Hells bells the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that.
Then theyre Lets whip em to death Throw em to the mandingos Feed em to Stonesiphers dogs.
And then I say Whats so special bout that We do that shit all the time.
Hells bells the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that.
He stops massaging Djangos balls.
STEPHEN So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company hence forth till the day you die you will be swinging a sledgehammer all day every day turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you its gonna be bout as much fun as it sounds.
We sell em the mandingos aint good for nuttin no more.
Like them three yall came back with.
For them big garboons we get twenty a piece.
They last bout six months.

Stephen turns to leave.
DJANGO Wheres Broomhilda STEPHEN Shes all right for now.
Miss Lara soft hearted on er.
She gave her to Billy Crash.
He was sweet on er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or smell too good but aint nobody gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.
CUT TO 137 EXT CANDYLAND AFTERNOON The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding up to the plantation.
It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a prison) ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon a 2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse and a white trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass plus a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods who all talk with thick Australian accents have stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

The Three mandingos who werent sold in Greenville Rodney Chicken Charly and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.

All three slaves carry the bundles of personal belongings theyve had since Greenville.

They climb into the cage wagon.
Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy the head Aussie pays Billy Crash for the slaves when we hear Ace Woody call out; ACE WOODY (OS) Hold on we got another hammer swinger for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django shirtless and barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story) wearing his old tan pants and his wrists bound by a rope.
ROY We cant use that skinny bastard.
ACE WOODY We got an arraignment with Mr.

CUT TO 146 EXT BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co.
Caravan has stopped and pulled over to the side of the road.
IN THE CAGE Rodney Chicken Charly and Chester sit in the cage and watch through the bars this new turn of events without any.
clear comprehension of what theyre watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining company employees and Django off in the distance (where they cant hear what theyre saying) having some sort of a discussion.
That includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a piece of paper.
INSERT: SMITTY BACALLS WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.
DJANGO I aint no goddamn slave.
Do I soundlike a fuckin slave Im a bounty hunter.

King Schultz.
Wed tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County.

But those four men are still back there.
Theyre still wanted.
And that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs.

Django is damn convincing.
ROY Whats your deal You tell us who they are and we let ya go DJANGO I aint tellin who they are.

As they walk Roy continues to study the handbill.
ROY (READING ALOUD) Wanted dead or alive.

For murder and stagecoach robbery.
Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
This is a real handbill.
FLOYD Just because the handbills real doesnt mean that other bunch of malarky.

ROY Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket Floyd doesnt have an answer for that one.
ROY That blacks damn convincing.
They get to The Cage OMen.
Roy startles them with a direct question; ROY (pointing behind him at Django) That black ride into Candyland yesterday The Caged Men dont know what theyre suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt cocks back the hammer and points the barrel at the cage.
ROY Im gonna ask again and remember I dont like liars.
Is he a Candyland slave or did he ride in with a white man yesterday CHESTER Yeah.
They walked us from the Greenville Auction and he rode on a horse with a white man.
ROY This white man was the black his slave RODNEY He werent no slave.
FLOYD You sure about that RODNEY Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall seriously.
ROY What happened at Candyland CHICKEN CHARLY Bunch of shootin master got shot.
ROY Who shot em CHICKEN CHARLY The German.
ROY And why did he do that CHICKEN CHARLY The nigger and the German were actin as if they were slavers but they werent.
ROY What were they RODNEY Bounty hunters.

FLOYD Goddamn Roy this could be big.

ROY Okay black you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.
DJANGO I got one more condition.
ROY What DJANGO When we get there when the time comes you let me help you kill em.
Roy whips out a big knife and cuts the rope around Djangos wrists.
ROY (LAUGHING) You got a deal black.
Django interrupts DJANGO You gotta deal mate.
Roy really laughs this time.
As does Django and the other two Aussies.
ROY Youre all right for a black fella THE CAGE Rodney Chicken Charly and Chester watch the sight of the white men cutting the ropes that bound the black mans wrists as well as them all sharing a laugh with wonderment.
Who is this Nigger BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET ROY Well give you that pack horse.
DJANGO Whats them saddle bags filled with FLOYD Dynamite.
so DJANGO I.
aint ridin no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back ROY (CHUCKLE CHUCKLE) Yeah I can see why.
Jano take those sticks off that horse and stick em in the nigger cage.
Jano does this lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off the pack horse and walking to the cage wagon unlocking the cage door and placing the bags inside.
The Black Men in the cage dont like this at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Djangos horse throws them over his shoulders and begins walking back to The Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse and says; DJANGO Wheres my pistol ROY Floyd you got that rifle on the wagon give em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt gun and all folds it up and walks over to Django handing it to him.
Django accepts it.
About the pistol Floyd tells Django; FLOYD Now dont drop it now.
I just had the sights fixed last month its perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.
DJANGO Thats good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE in the chest.
Roy turns around.
Django takes the gun out of the holster.
BAM.
ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.
Janos shoulder.
KAHBOOM Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS.
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass.
The CAGE WAGON Rodney Chester and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the blast.
The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in the air obscuring all visibility.
THEN.
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away REVEALING in bright color focus.
DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies and whatever is left of Jano.
Hes shoeless and shirtless but Floyds pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage.
He then moves towards the wagon and unhooks the mine company beast and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane he digs his heels into the beasts side.
The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider.
By now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses and horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men.
THEN.
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the cage door.
He looks at the three men especially Rodney then says; DJANGO Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horses neck turns the beast around and without saying another word rides back in the direction of Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos watch him ride away.
Who was that nigger CUT TO l.
rz A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candies Coffin carried by eight pallbearers Stephen Moguy Bartholomew Ace Woody Brown Cody and his best mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress wide brim black hat black veil and ever present black Mammy (Cora) crying at her side.
CORA The skys real pretty Miss Lara.
Monsieur Candie think it real nice.
LARA LEE Ah bless you sweet innocent Cora.
WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland.
The bare backed black man riding the horse bareback holding the RIFLE in one hand a fistful of the horses mane in the other hauling ass against a gorgeous SUNSET SKY looks like an Indian.
EXT TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE SUNSET The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack Bunkhouse that Mr.
Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse.
INT TRACKER SHACK SUNSET The FOUR TRACKERS are.
missing the funeral hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards.
Mr.
Stonesipher Lex and Stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker except the way you get rid of your cards is different.
Instead of chips they play with NIGGER EARS (yes the ears of slaves).
On a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake the biggest is off by himself pounding nails into a small delicate BIRDHOUSE hes making.
EXT WOODSOUTSIDE THE SHACK SUNSET INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping.
Djangos bare feet jump on to the ground.
IS3 INT DOG KENNEL SUNSET The FOUR DOGS lay out.
when Marsha hears something and raises her head.
SHIRTLESS DJANGO moves quietly through the woods.
MARSHA rises to all fours to listen and smell.
out in the darkness her three PALS continue to lay out.
DJANGO BY A TREE he can see the bunkhouse entrance the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the chopping block the kennel and the one dog looking his way.
MARSHA BARK The Other Three Dogs wake up and go on alert.
Django disappears.
INT TRACKER SHACK SUNSET They hear the barking inside.
Mr.
STONESIPHER Jake Jake building his birdhouse.
JAKE Yeah Mr.
STONESIPHER Check on Marsha.
Jake the one not playing the game puts aside his hammer and rises to check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).
EXT TRACKER SHACK As the BARKING gets louder WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the chopping block and Djangos hand REMOVING IT.
JAKE opens the bunkhouse doorhe sees directly a hundred feet in front of him Django standing there with the axe.
Just as he reacts.
DJANGO.
THROWS THE AXE.
JAKE.
IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.
After letting go of the axe handle Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered whats happening Django has crossed the distance and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKES FACE.
And with AXE in hand Django chases and fights with all three trackers till after a point where hes CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM Lex and Stew and now theres only Mr.
Stonesipher left.
But Mr.
Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE and is able to fight back against Django.
You know Stonesiphers great with a knife plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs attack attack attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons.
Then its just a fight of brute strength and survival.
Mr.
Stonesipher is physically bigger then Django.
But if Djangos going to save Broomhilda not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers he has to take Stonesiphers ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white mans domination all his life and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs fight each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesiphers neck in a headlock but the mountain boy is big enough to lift Django.
So like a rodeo rider holding onto bull for dear life Django tightens his lock around his opponents neck.
Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building the birdhouse with and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF STONESIPHERS HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT The FUNERAL NIGHT The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway.
The Preacher reads some words over him.
EXT TRACKER SHACK NIGHT Django half naked splattered with blood from the axe murders steps out of the shack.
He takes a wash basin off the window sill and walks over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friendscontinue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times and water explodes into the bowl.
He begins washing the bloodoffof himself.
As he washes he says outloud; DJANGO What ya doin around here boy Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.
TIMMY I was just walkin by.
DJANGO Wanna help me out TIMMY Sure.
DJANGO My woman Hildi is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is TIMMY Sure do.
DJANGO You show me TIMMY Will I get in trouble DJANGO Not by the time I get through killin everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that.
He believes him.
TIMMY Ill show ya.
THEN.
Django turns towards the barking dogs.
He turns back to Timmy and asks; DJANGO You know what toadstools look like 15C TIMMY Sure do.
DJANGO Go pick me a mess of em.
INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in the tracker shack.
Timmy comesin carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.
Stonesiphers BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce and mixes it up with the spoon.
EXT MARSHAS KENNEL NIGHT Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs are nevertheless still dogs and greedily scarf up the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.
DJANGO You bit your last nigger bitch Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.
DJANGO First things first boy.
Take me to my horse.
EXT FUNERAL NIGHT The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.
TNT STABLEBLACKSMITH NIGHT Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds.
Django goes straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello.
Tonys happy to see him.
Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.
Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultzs horse Fritz in the stable.
DJANGO Saddle up Fritz and Tony.
Timmy just stares.
DJANGO Now boy Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.
Schultz he takes Broomhildas bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket.
He also searches for and finds Schultzs hidden DERRINGER he keeps it in a holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses he asks; TIMMY Do you feel bad for your friend Django rises from the body of his friend.
DJANGO Yeah I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says; TIMMY I know just how ya feel.
I lost a white friend once.
He drowned in the lake.
Django doesnt correct the difference between Dr.
Schultz and a white friend because theres nothing he could say to Timmy to make him understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes which still lie next to the furnace.
He Puts on his boots.
His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
And finally his hat.
EXT The FUNERAL NIGHT The service is over everybody is hugging each other and holding hands and beginning to leave.
INT BILLY CRASHS SHACK NIGHT Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda.
She doesnt wail she doesnt make any whimpering sounds but her eyes constantly water.
As Billys fucking her he says; BILLY CRASH Its gonna be real nice round here now the ol mans gone.

BILLY CRASH Now girl Im tryin to be nice.

But you know Ive always been sweet on you.
I dont wanna bust your ass.
So dont make me Now Im gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed.
She cries for Django she cries for herself.
THEN.
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND and a MUFFLED Ooomph SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy Crashs shack she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door.
CU BROOMHILDA Her face stained with tears watches the door.
A soft Knock Knock on the door.
BROOMHILDA (SOFTLY) Yes The VOICE on the other side of the door says; DJANGOS VOICE (OS) Hey Little Trouble Maker.
157 She hops out of bed and throws open the door.
THERE HE IS she runs into his arms.
EXT The FUNERAL NIGHT The TWO OLD SLAVE.
GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of dirt on Monsieur Calvin J.
Candies coffin.
The participants of this ritual begin to move away from the grave.
The funeral is a private affair just the Candie Family Unit some of the overseers and the slaves.
No one from town except the Preacher.
The SLAVE MOURNERS begin.
to move towards their living area all saying goodbye to Miss Lara.
Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to them.
A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the hill back to the big house.
EXT BILLY CRASHS SHACK NIGHT Django with Broomhilda.

He sends her on her way.
Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house.
(60 EXT The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE NIGHT The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk back to The Big House for a drink.
This Candie Family Unit consists of: LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
CORA (unarmed) her mammy walks with Miss Lara holding her hand.
STEPHEN.
(unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his normal House Nigger outfit walks on the other side of his mistress Miss Lara holding her other hand.

and finally SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candies two prized mandingos wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew.
This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral drinks.
They enter the lawn in front of The Big House and head for the front door.
Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the property by some shed.
They see The Candie Family Unit all dressed in their darkest finery walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
The woman and little boy stop.
But the group of enemies arent looking their way.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT moves closer towards the front of The Big House.
WHEN.
The front of The Big House EXPLODES knocking the.
Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
BROOMHILDA and TIMMY cant believe their eyes.
I6 I WOOD STONE PLASTER DIRT DUST GLASS SMOKE GUNPOWDER hang in the air.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT starts coming to their senses.
Nobody was killed or even seriously hurt (unless you count eardrums) just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened their eyes look up from the ground and try and see through the smoke and dust.
TheSMOKE and DUST thins a little and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated but The Big House front steps remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE walking towards them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.
FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE then MISS LARA sees it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY on the ground his hand starts to move towards the gun around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.
is carrying something in his left hand.
its Floyds Winchester he raises it and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODYs hand moves away from his gun.
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE.
Its DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO OUTFIT.

Nobody can believe Djangos standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House looking down at The Candie Family Unit all lying on the front lawn Winchester rifle held casually in his left hand.
His right hand held casually by the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT all on their ass in the grass look up at Django with a mixture of Wonder Fear and Hate.
ICZ WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big House front lawn.
and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says; DJANGO I bet I.

DJANGO Everybody stand up Its now Django who gives the orders.
They stand up quickly.
Django with the rifle pointing at them just looks at The Candie Family Unit.
Enjoying their collective hatred.
THEN.
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster as he takes a SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGOs intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps at the ten people and says; DJANGO All black folks take ten steps away from the white folks.
DJANGOs eyes go to STEPHEN who looks back at him.
DJANGO Not you Stephen.
Youre right where you belong.
163 The Black Folks Cora Bartholomew Samson and Goldie begin taking ten steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE cant believe Coras leaving her.

The WITNESSES cant fathom what theyjust witnessed.
/65 All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT.
But some are still alive.
We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE CODY and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit not to mention blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGOS PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House feeling tremendous satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.
Schultzs tiny Derringer from Stephens dead hand putting it in his pocket.
Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As hewalks up to Broomhilda on Fritz he says; DJANGO Hey Little Trouble Maker.
BROOMHILDA Hey Big Trouble Maker.
