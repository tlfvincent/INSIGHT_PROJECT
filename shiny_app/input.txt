and immediately gets pummeled all over again.
Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of flame.

OOGWAY (CONTD) You are too concerned with what was and what will be.

Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
COMMANDER Fire Crossbows Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls creating a makeshift staircase.
ZENG Tai Lung is free I must warn Shifu The Commander shuts the Goose up.
COMMANDER Youre not going anywhere.
And neither is he.
ZENG Let go of me COMMANDER (to guards) Bring it up 38.
The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise.
A rhino guard tries to reach it but just misses.
RHINO GUARD #1 Wait Bring it back ZENG Hes coming this way COMMANDER He wont get far.
(to guards) Archers Leaping across the spears Tai Lung catches the elevator as the volley of arrows flies down past him.
The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit.
Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and catches the guards by surprise.
He grabs the chain and jumps over the edge and swings around launching himself up to the next tier disappearing into the shadows.
Tai Lung lands on a bridge fights his way through finally reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the Rhino army await.

So very very dead.
The Commander hushes the Goose.
COMMANDER (to Goose) Heh heh.

Massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble.
Tai Lung leaps across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump towards the Commander.
But he falls short claws scraping and sparking against the rock wall.
The Commander laughs maniacally.
On his way down Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning down to the last group of explosives.
He leaps across the raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
Grabbing a hold of the dynamite Tai Lung falls and slings it ahead of him at the guards.

Shifu flings two boards into the air.
Instantly Tigress leaps up and executes a perfect split kick.
Po is awestruck.
As Tigress lands the broken chunks of board land all around Po knocking him on the head.
Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir.

The Five exchange worried looks.
SHIFU (to Po) Step forth.
Po doesnt even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
SHIFU (CONTD) The true path to victory is to find your opponents weakness and make him suffer for it.
PO (delighted) Oh yeah Shifu whips Po around again.
SHIFU To take his strength and use it against him.
Again this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
SHIFU (CONTD) until he finally falls or quits.

SHIFU Illusion OOGWAY Yeah.

I cannot make it blossom when it suits me nor make it bear fruit before its time.
SHIFU But there are things we can control.
Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
SHIFU (CONTD) I can control when the fruit will fall.
A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles.
Shifu tosses the peach in the air leaps up and splits it with a chop.
SHIFU (CONTD) And I can control Shifu punches the ground creating a hole and places the seed in it.
SHIFU (CONTD) where to plant the seed.

SHIFU Dont cry.
PO Okay.
Po sniffs the tears back and smiles.
EXT.
FIELD LATER Shifu leads Po out into an open field.
SHIFU When you focus on Kung Fu when you concentrate.
you stink.
Po scowls.
62.
SHIFU (CONTD) But perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
I now see that the way to get through to you is with this Shifu produces a bowl of dumplings.
PO Oh great `cause Im hungry.
SHIFU Good.
When you have been trained you may eat.
Let us begin.
EXT.
FIELD LATER Pos training unfolds deep breathing exercises balance tests push ups sit ups climbing etc.
Through it all he never gets to eat although he does indeed learn kung fu.
EXT.
CLEARING A MOMENT LATER Shifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder.
SHIFU After you panda.
Po stops short suspicious.
PO Just like that No situps No ten mile hike SHIFU I vowed to train you.
and you have been trained.
You are free to eat.
Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.
SHIFU (CONTD) Enjoy.
Po raises the dumpling to his mouth.
WHOOSH Shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself.
PO Hey 63.
SHIFU I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.
Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks the dumpling into the air.
PO Hey Shifu eats it and Po scowls.
SHIFU You are free to eat PO (upset) Am I SHIFU (challenging) Are you Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks.
Po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne.
Back and forth Po and Shifu spar vying for the dumplings.
Until there is only one left.
Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po.
He hides it underneath one of the bowls.
He uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack Pos chopsticks away.
He attacks Po with his bamboo staff.
But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final dumpling.
Shifu smiles.
Po has passed the final test.
But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifus open hand.
PO Im not hungry.
master.
Master and pupil bow to each other.
CUT TO: EXT.
MOUNTAIN PASS The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain peaks.
64.
Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge.
He ROARS and races toward them.
TIGRESS Cut it The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain.
Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the final rope.
But Tai Lung is too close Tigress must launch herself into him.
The two cats end up in the middle of the bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below.
The Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
TAI LUNG Wheres the Dragon Warrior TIGRESS How do you know youre not looking at her Tai Lung laughs.
It echoes off the mountain walls.
TAI LUNG You think Im a fool I know youre not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you The Five exchange quick worried looks.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) (nodding confidently) I heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire that hes a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
The Five exchange quick confused looks.
MONKEY Po TAI LUNG So that is his name Po.
Finally a worthy opponent.
Our battle will be legendary Tigress charges at him.
The battle begins.
Tigress punches Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge.
But Tai Lung counters with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through the bridges wooden slats.
Then Tigress gets choked by the bridges ropes.
Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
MONKEY Weve got this.
Help her 65.
Viper grabs Tai Lung which causes him to let go of the ropes.
Tigress plummets down into the gorge.
but Crane manages to catch her.
Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with his own fist.
Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Vipers throat.
VIPER Monkey ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY.
Mantis is straining to hold the rope by himself.
MANTIS Go (then) Ack What was I thinking Monkey leaps into action kicking Tai Lung in the chest and sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge.
He gets back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single strand of rope.
TIGRESS Mantis Mantis whips his end of the rope sending a sine wave shooting toward Tai Lung.
The rope whips Tai Lung in the face and he gets tangled up.
The Five see their chance.
TIGRESS (CONTD) Now Working as a team the Five kick Tai Lungs butt every which way.
Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai Lung.
He plummets down.
down.
disappearing into the mist.
Mantis whips his end of the rope returning his buddies safely to the mountain.
The Five look relieved.
But the relief is shortlived.
Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling the far mountain peak.
Her eyes go wide with dread.
The rope whips up.
But Tai Lung isnt there.
With a crash he suddenly appears behind the Five.
TAI LUNG Shifu taught you well.
Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey who instantly freezes.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) But he didnt teach you everything.
66.
Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
EXT.
TRAINING HALL EVENING Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard.
Po has an easy spring in his step.
SHIFU You have done well Panda.
PO Done well Done well Ive done awesome He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
Shifu staggers back regaining his dignity.
SHIFU The mark of a true hero is humility After a moments thought though he leans toward Po SHIFU (CONTD) But yes.
you have done awesome.
And he punches him playfully on the arm.
Po smiles at him.
As they LAUGH an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind them.
ITS CRANE Crane carries the five to the palace grounds crashing in a heap.
PO Huh Guys Guys Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
PO (CONTD) Theyre dead No theyre breathing Theyre asleep No their eyes are open.
Crane struggles to lift his head.
CRANE We were no match for his nerve attack.
His head collapses to the ground.
67.
SHIFU He has gotten stronger.
PO Who Tai Lung Stronger Shifu starts freeing the Five.
First Viper then Mantis then Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis MONKEY Hes too fast He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Pos head and then slowly realizes where he is.
MONKEY (CONTD) Sorry Po.
Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
TIGRESS I thought we could stop him.
SHIFU He could have killed you.
MANTIS Why didnt he SHIFU So you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts.
But it wont work PO Uh it might I mean a little.
Im pretty scared.
SHIFU You can defeat him panda.
PO Are you kidding If they cant Theyre five masters.
Im just one me.
SHIFU But you will have the one thing that no one else does.
68.
INT.
SCROLL ROOM MOMENTS LATER CLOSEUP of the Dragon Scroll.
Po stares at Shifu then looks up at the Scroll.
Then back at Shifu PO You really believe Im ready SHIFU You are Po.
They look at each other.
This is a big moment.
Oogways staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles.
As Po and The Five stand by Shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool.
Shifu bows his head then eyes still closed he raises the staff up above his head.
Po and the others watch expectantly.
The peach blossom petals rise in a flickering spinning cloud up from the pool.
The gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the Dragon Scroll.
The petals loosen the scroll from the dragons mouth and it falls.
At the last second Shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it.
He turns to Po holding it out.
SHIFU (CONTD) Behold.
The Dragon Scroll.
It is yours.
PO Wait what happens when I read it SHIFU No one knows but legend says you will be able to hear a butterflys wingbeat.
PO Whoa Really Thats cool.
SHIFU Yes.
And see light in the deepest cave.
You will feel the universe in motion around you.
PO Wow Can I punch through walls Can I do a quadruple back flip Will I have invisibility SHIFU Focus.
Focus.
69.
PO Huh Oh yeah.

SHIFU Read it Po and fulfill your destiny.
Read it and become.
the Dragon Warrior PO Whooaa Po takes a deep breath.
Then he grasps the tube and tries to pull the top off it.
It doesnt budge.
He strains at it.
PO (CONTD) Its impossible to open.
He strains again.
He tries to bite it off.
PO (CONTD) Come on baby.
Come on now.
Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand.
Po passes him the tube.
Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
PO (CONTD) Thank you.
I probably loosened it up for you though.
Okay here goes.
He glances at the Five.
They look on in awe.
Monkey gives him the `thumbs up.
Po starts to unroll the scroll the golden light bathing his face.
Across the scroll we see Shifu excited that he is witness to history.
On Pos face as he finishes opening the scroll.
Then PO (CONTD) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Shifu looks concerned.
The Five look concerned.
Po looks utterly terrified.
PO (CONTD) Its blank SHIFU What PO Here Look 70.
Po tries to show Shifu the scroll.
Shifu covers his eyes and turns his head away.
SHIFU No I am forbidden to look upon But he cant help himself.
He takes a peek.
Then he GRABS if off Po.
He turns it around then upside down.
He closes it and opens it again astonished.
SHIFU (CONTD) Blank I dont.
I dont understand.
Shifu turns away contemplative.
What can this mean PO Okay.
So like Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all SHIFU No.
Oogway was wiser than us all.
Po sits heavily on the floor dejected.
PO Oh come on Face it.
He picked me by accident.
Of course Im not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding The Five dont argue.
TIGRESS But who will stop Tai Lung CRANE Hell destroy everything.
and everyone.
Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it.
He looks oddly calm as he turns around.
SHIFU No evacuate the Valley.
You must protect the villagers from Tai Lungs rage.
TIGRESS What about you master SHIFU I will fight him.
71.
PO What SHIFU I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
PO But Shifu hell kill you.
SHIFU Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
The Five and Po look devastated.
SHIFU (CONTD) Listen to me all of you.
It is time for you to continue your journey without me.
I am very proud to have been your master.
Shifu salutes them and turns away.
Po is heartbroken.
Crane steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po pulling away.
Po resists for a moment then lets the Five lead him off.
CUT TO: EXT.
VALLEY The Five arrive at the base of the stairs.
TIGRESS Weve got to get them out safely.
Monkey picks up a small child.
MONKEY Come little one.
Lets find your mama.
TIGRESS Viper gather the southern farmers.
Mantis the north.
Crane light the way.
They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate.
Po is left by himself.
He makes his way through the bustling town.
72.
JR SHAW (skeptically) Look its the Dragon Warrior.
Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
PO Hey Dad.
POS DAD Po Seeing Po Pos Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around his son.
Po bends down to reciprocate the hug as Pos dad pulls away having fastened an apron around Pos waist.
POS DAD (CONTD) Good to have you back son PO (listlessly) Good to be back.
Pos Dad goes back to packing things up.
POS DAD Lets go Po.
So for our next shop its time to face it the future of noodles is dicecut vegetables no longer slices.
Dad starts to walk off unaware that Po isnt following.
POS DAD (CONTD) Also I was thinking maybe this time well have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
Hmm You like that He turns and notices that Po hasnt moved.
He walks to Po sympathetically.
POS DAD (CONTD) Po Im sorry things didnt work out.
It just.

Po slumps against the cart.
POS DAD (CONTD) Po forget everything else.
Your destiny still awaits.
We are noodle folk broth runs deep through our veins.
73.
PO I dont know Dad.
Honestly sometimes I cant believe Im actually your son.
Dad is taken aback.
POS DAD Po I think its time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago.
PO Okay.
Dad pauses dramatically.
POS DAD The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup Po feigns excitement.
PO Oh.
POS DAD Cmere The secret ingredient is.
nothing PO Huh POS DAD You heard me.
Nothing.
There is no secret ingredient PO Wait wait.
its just plain old noodle soup You dont add some kind of special sauce or something POS DAD Dont have to.
To make something special you just have to believe its special.
Po looks at his father with dawning realization.
He picks up the Scroll.
For a moment Po stares at his reflection on the scroll then he smiles serenely.
He gets it now.
74.
PO There is no secret ingredient.
Po turns back to look at the palace.
CUT TO: EXT.
JADE PALACE DAWN At the top of the stairs Shifu looks upon the Valley awaiting his fate.
With a gust of wind Tai Lung appears before him.
TAI LUNG I have come home Master.
SHIFU This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.
TAI LUNG Yes.
You have a new favorite.
So where is this.
Po Did I scare him off SHIFU This battle is between you and me.
TAI LUNG So.
That is how its going to be SHIFU That is how it must be.
They fight.
At last.
Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the doors of the Jade Palace.
Tai Lung enters.
TAI LUNG I rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness SHIFU Obeying your master is not weakness TAI LUNG You knew I was the Dragon Warrior You always knew.
Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
75.
A young Tai Lung looks expectant.
Oogway shakes his head.
TAI LUNG (V.
) (CONTD) But when Oogway said otherwise what did you do What did you do Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) NOTHING Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
SHIFU You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior That was not my fault TAI LUNG NOT YOUR FAULT Enraged Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and throws them at Shifu.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY BONES CRACKED WHO DENIED ME MY DESTINY Shifu dodges each attack.
SHIFU It was never my decision to make Tai Lung pulls Oogways staff from the shrine.
TAI LUNG It is now.
They fight.
Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) Give me the scroll SHIFU I would rather die.
They struggle for a beat until finally the staff splinters into a hundred pieces.
Shifu looks back at the pieces and a flutter of peach tree petals fly by.
Caught off guard Shifu gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
76.
Shifu climbs the column to the rafters.
Tai Lung follows and sends them both crashing through the roof.
Lightning flash.
Grappling in midair Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifus throat as they crash back through the roof.
They kick apart.
Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the floor.
Flames go everywhere.
Tai Lungs arms are aflame as he charges at Shifu.
TAI LUNG All I ever did I did to make you proud Tell me how proud you are Shifu Tell me TELL ME THOOM A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor and crashing against the reflecting pool.
The flames extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
SHIFU (weakly) I have always been proud of you.
From the first moment Ive been proud of you.
And it was my pride that blinded me.
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming.
What I was turning you into.
Im.
sorry.
Tai Lung stops in his tracks.
Shifu waits.
Tai Lungs expression goes cold.
He grabs Shifu by the throat.
TAI LUNG I dont want your apology.
I want my scroll He holds Shifu up to the ceiling.
Looking up Tai Lung bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) WHAT WHERE IS IT Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
SHIFU (weakly) Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by now.
You will never see that scroll Tai Lung.
Never.
Never.
77.
Tai Lung is furious.
He roars ready to strike Shifu.
Suddenly.
PO (O.
) Hey Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
PO (CONTD) (out of breath) Stairs.
Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
TAI LUNG Who are you PO Buddy I am the Dragon Warrior.
(exhales hard) Huhhh.
TAI LUNG You Him (to Shifu) Hes a panda.
(back to Po) Youre a panda.
What are you gonna do big guy Sit on me PO Dont tempt me.
Haha.
No.
Im gonna use this.
You want it Come and get it.
Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
From out of nowhere Tai Lung appears and punches Po across the room grabbing the scroll knocked from Pos hands.
TAI LUNG Finally Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung sending him flying into a column.
Po puts on a brave face and strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges.
Po turns to run.
Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace steps.
Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
78.
Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and smash Tai Lung.
He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes right back at Po.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) That scroll is mine Down the Theater steps Po and Tai Lung grapple for the scroll.
Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion his voluminous butt presses down on Tai Lungs head.
As they crash through the Gateway the scroll is knocked loose.
Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po snatches it away using a noodle lasso.
The scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head.
Tai Lung leaps for it but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which seesaws Po into the air.
In midair Po slurps the noodle.
Up and over the rooftops Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop.
The scroll rolls to a stop in the street.
As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll Po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game sliding the woks around to hide the scroll.
PO Lightning Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung.
The leopard swipes out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river.
Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth.
As Tai Lung chases down the scroll he turns back to see Po flying through the fireworksfilled sky.
Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall.
The scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon.
He looks back at Tai Lung who sees where the scroll has landed.
Via the magic of cookie vision Po effortlessly scales the building.
Tai Lung is shocked.
TAI LUNG The scroll has given him power.
(then) NOOO0 He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall.
The resulting shockwave collapses the building.
79.
Amazingly Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in midair as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the ground.
As Tai Lung lands he delivers a final devastating punch.
As the dust settles Tai Lung is looming over Po in the impact crater.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) (out of breath) Finally.
oh yes.
the power of the Dragon Scroll.
is mine Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it.
His face falls.
TAI LUNG (CONTD) Its NOTHING Po stirs.
PO Its okay.
I didnt get it the first time either.
TAI LUNG (disbelief) What Po gets to his feet.
PO There is no secret ingredient.
Its just you.
Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
TAI LUNG RRRAAAH PO AAAAGGGHH Tai Lung attacks Pos nerve points.
But Po begins giggling.
PO (CONTD) Stop Stop it Im gonna pee Dont Dont Tai Lungs nerve attack has no effect on Po.
Frustrated he delivers a doublefisted punch to Pos belly.
80.
The shockwave ripples through Pos entire body and Pos arms come back and strike Tai Lung sending the leopard crashing back into a building.
Po looks at his hands amazed at what he just did.
Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again.
But Po strikes back using an unorthodox pandastyle technique even getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail.
Po gives Tai Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building.
Tai Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po.
But Po prepares.
and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Pos IRON BELLY He is launched into the air.
Po waits.
and waits.
until finally Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground.
Tai Lung is battered but still defiant.
TAI LUNG (heavy breathing) You.
cant defeat me.
Youre just a big fat panda SCHWING Po grabs Tai Lungs finger.
Tai Lungs eyes go wide.
PO Im not a big fat panda.
Im the big fat panda.
Pos pinky pops up.
Tai Lung gasps.
TAI LUNG The Wuxi Finger Hold PO Oh you know this hold TAI LUNG Youre bluffing.
Youre bluffing Shifu didnt teach you that.
PO Nope.
I figured it out.
He flexes his pinky.
PO (CONTD) Skadoosh KATHOOM 81.
EXT.
VALLEY OF PEACE A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley sweeping past the Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.
DISSOLVE TO: EXT.
VALLEY SQUARE A LITTLE LATER Villagers emerge from hiding.
Po walks out from the mist looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
KG SHAW Look The Dragon Warrior.
As he nears we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron.
Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior.
Pos Dad emerges from the crowd.
POS DAD Thats my boy.
That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son PO Thanks Dad.
Po hugs his dad.
The wok falls off Pos head and rolls on the ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it.
The rest of the Five are with him.
Po takes notice.
PO (CONTD) Hey guys.
TIGRESS Master.
Tigress bows deeply.
The others follow.
FURIOUS FIVE Master.
PO (modest) Master (then remembering) Master Shifu Po races toward the Jade Palace.
He climbs the steps.
Then more steps.
82.
INT.
PALACE MOMENTS LATER Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace.
Shifu is still lying in the scroll room his eyes closed.
Po rushes to his side.
PO Master Shifu Shifu Are you okay Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
SHIFU Po Youre alive (then darkly) Or were both dead.
PO No Master I didnt die.
I defeated Tai Lung SHIFU You did Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
SHIFU (CONTD) Wow.
It is as Oogway foretold You are the Dragon Warrior.
You have brought peace to this Valley.
And to me.
Thank you.
Thank you Po.
Thank you.
Shifu closes his eyes.
He is still.
Po starts freaking out.
PO No Master No No No Dont die Shifu.
Please.
SHIFU (eyes snapping open) Im not dying you idiot ah Dragon Warrior.
Im simply at peace.
Finally.
PO Oh.
So um I should.
stop talking SHIFU If you can.
Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again.
Master and pupil lie next to each other.
The camera pulls up and back away from them.
Po tries to remain still but its hard.
83.
Hes about to say something but he stops himself.
He fidgets for a beat then cant control himself any longer.
PO Want to get something to eat SHIFU (sighs) Yeah.
IRIS OUT.
THE END.
